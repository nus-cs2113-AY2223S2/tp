# User Guide

Clanki is a command-line interface (CLI) application for managing flashcards. It
allows users to create, manage and study flashcards to assist them with
memorisation by using a technique called
[spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed.

2. Download the latest version of Clanki from
   [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T15-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Clanki.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and
   use the `java -jar clanki.jar` command to run the application. You should be
   greeted with `Welcome to Clanki! Time to start studying!` after a few
   seconds.

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. Some
   example commands you can try:

    - `add /q what is the worst fruit? /a durian`: Add a flashcard with
      Question:
      What is the worst fruit? and Answer: Durian to the list of flashcards.

    - `review`: Go through the flashcards that are due today.

    - `bye`: Exit the app.

6. Refer to the Features below for details of each command.

## Features

> Square brackets indicate optional sections of the syntax.

### Adding a flashcard

```
add /q QUESTION /a ANSWER
```

- `QUESTION` will be displayed when reviewing. For how the reviewing process
  works, see "Review flashcards" section below.

- Since a slash character (`/`) can be interpreted as a command option, both
  `QUESTION` and `ANSWER` must not include (`/`). (In some of the times, `/`
  might still work normally, that's just you being lucky.)

    - We might fix this in a future version. A far, far future version that
      might
      never come...

- `/q QUESTION` and `/a ANSWER` can be arranged in any order.

- The first letter of `QUESTION` and `ANSWER` are automatically capitalised.

- If any options are duplicated, all but the last one are ignored.

- The question and answer can include non-Latin characters such as Chinese
  characters. However, your terminal might have trouble displaying it. If you
  need such characters, find a terminal that supports it. A relatively modern
  terminal (more modern than cmd.exe) should do, or buy a Mac since the default
  Mac terminal does support it.

#### Example

```
add /q What is the worst fruit? /a Durian
You have added the following card:
Q: What is the worst fruit?
A: Durian
```

```
add /a 果物 /q What is the Japanese word for "fruit"?
You have added the following card:
Q: What is the Japanese word for "fruit"?
A: 果物
```

### Review flashcards

```
review
```

- Flashcards that are due on the day will be displayed one after another, queued
  in a secret order.

- When the user has recalled the answer for a card, or has given up on doing so,
  they can then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

- The app will then show the answer and ask the user if they got it right. They
  can then type `y`/`n` to indicate that they remembered the answer correctly,
  or they couldn't remember the correct answer, respectively.

    - If `y` is indicated, the card is then set to a new due date in the
      future.When the user has got it correct, the new date is set to a future
      date according to a top-secret
      [Spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)
      schedule that you can try to figure out if you want to explore mysteries.
    - If `n` is indicated, the card is pushed back to the today's queue for
      reviewing later, until the user can get it correct.
    - If a command other than `y` or `n` is indicated, it will be regarded as an
      invalid command, and then the user will be prompted again to enter a valid
      answer.

- Then the review session continues with the next card in the queue.

#### Example

```
> review
There are 2 cards available for review today.
---
Q: What is the worst fruit? (ENTER to view answer)
A: Durian
Did you get it right? (y/n) n
No worries, we will try again later today.

```

### Update flashcards

```
update QUERY
```

- `QUERY` is part of the card's question or answer. It is not case sensitive.

- A list of cards that contain this query will be listed, with an index assigned
  to each.

- The user can then type the index of the card they wish to update with the
  following syntax

  ```
  INDEX [/q NEW_QUESTION] [/a NEW_ANSWER]
  ```

- At least one of `/q` and `/a` must be provided.

- Format of `NEW_QUESTION` and `NEW_ANSWER` is the same as in the `add` command
  above.

#### Example

```
update fruit

[1]
Q: What is the worst fruit?

### Delete a flashcard

```

```

- `QUERY` can be part of the card's question or answer.

- A list of cards that contain this query will be listed, with an index assigned
  to each.

  with that index (on that list) is then deleted.
