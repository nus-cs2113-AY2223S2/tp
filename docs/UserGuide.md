### Other Notes
* Should additional fields that is not required be added to the input, the program will ignore it.
<br> e.g. field "a" with value "1" will be ignored for `add expense /c meal /de breakfast @Technoedge /da 22-03-2023 /v 3.50 /a 1`, and `exit /de 1` will still successfully exit the program.
* ChChing will not allow duplicate fields within the same input.
<br> e.g. `add expense /c meal /c meal /de breakfast @Technoedge /da 22-03-2023 /v 3.50` will not be allowed since it has duplicate category fields.
* ChChing allows for the fields' order to be changed.
<br> e.g. `add expense /de breakfast @Technoedge /c meal /da 22-03-2023 /v 3.50` will add the expense successfully.
* ChChing allows command and argument fields to be case-insensitive. However, the values of the fields would be stored according to the case of the input.
<br> e.g. `EDIT INCOME /IN 1 /DE DINNER` would successfully edit the description of the first income recorded to `DINNER`.
* ChChing will allow for duplicate entries to be added. No warning would be raised.
* ChChing will not allow for the user to use '/', unless it is used to specify the field.
<br> e.g. `add expense /c meal /de breakfast / lunch /da 22-03-2023 /v 3.50` will be allowed.
* For values that require double/float, ChChing will only allow for 2 decimal places. Furthermore, ChChing will not accept values that does not have a number before the decimal point.
<br> e.g. `.01` and `0.001` is not taken as a valid value, but `0.01` is.
