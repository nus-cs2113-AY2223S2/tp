Difficulty Level: beginner
Workout Type: upper body
Start by placing the middle of the V-bar in the middle of the pull-up bar (assuming that the pull-up station you are using does not have neutral grip handles). The V-Bar handles will be facing down so that you can hang from the pull-up bar through the use of the handles., Once you securely place the V-bar, take a hold of the bar from each side and hang from it. Stick your upper body out and lean yourself back slightly in order to better engage the upper body. This will be your starting position., Using your upper body, pull your torso up while leaning your head back slightly so that you do not hit yourself with the chin-up bar. Continue until your upper body nearly touches the V-bar. Exhale as you execute this motion., After a second hold on the contracted position, slowly lower your body back to the starting position as you breathe in., Repeat for the prescribed number of repetitions.

Exercise ID: 95. 
Name: Body Tricep Press

Workout Type: upper body
Position a bar in a rack at upper body height., Standing, take a shoulder width grip on the bar and step a yard or two back, feet together and upper body extended so that you are leaning on the bar. This will be your starting position., Begin by flexing the elbow, lowering yourself towards the bar., Pause, and then reverse the motion by extending the elbows., Progress from bodyweight by adding chains over your upper body.
