### Adding an event: `add`
Adds an event to the schedule. Assuming x is an switch. Use –x to specify the attributes to edit.

Format: `add –e EVENTNAME –st STARTTIME –sd STARTDATE –et ENDTIME –ed ENDDATE -v VENUE -r RECURRING TIME`
* sd and ed must be of the format YYYY/MM/DD
* e, sd and st are compulsory fields
* ed and et are optional, but they must be written together if you use them
* v is optional
* r is optional, the format is x D/ x W, which means the event will happen in every x day/x week.

#### Examples of usage
1. Add event that starts and ends on different days: `add -e Career Fair -st 14:00 -sd 2023/02/10 -et 16:00 -ed 2023/02/11`
2. Add event that happens every week: `add -e collect mails -st 08:00 -sd 2023/02/10 -et 08:10 -ed 2023/02/10 -r 1 W`

**notice:** 

> date/time formats like 8:00 or 2023/4/1 are not accepted. The format should be strictly	`two digits`:`two digits`	(08:00 and 2023/04/01 in this case).


Expected outcome:

1. ~~~
	____________________________________________________________
	Event successfully added: 00 -sd 2023/02/10 -et 16:00 -ed 2023/02/11
	
    	> [E] Career Fair (2023/02/10 14:00 to 2023/02/11 16:00 not recurring)
	____________________________________________________________
	~~~

2. ~~~
   ____________________________________________________________
   Event successfully added: 8:00 -sd 2023/02/10 -et 08:10 -ed 2023/02/10 -r 1 W
   
       > [E] collect mails (2023/02/10 08:00 to 2023/02/10 08:10 | recurring, time interval: 1 Week(s))
   ____________________________________________________________
   ~~~
   



**confliction checking: ** 

- the app will only check conflictions between events and classes that have **starting date & time and ending date & time, within the time period of selected semester. **
- Users need to check themselves whether the events will clash with each other during vacation periods.


### Adding a module: `add`
Adds a module to the schedule. Assuming x is an switch. Use –x to specify the attributes to edit.

Format: `add –m MODULECODE -n CLASSNUMBER -l LESSONTYPE`
* All fields are compulsory

#### Examples of usage
* Add a lecture of module: `add -m AC5001 -n 1 -l lecture`
* Add a tutorial of module: `add -m CS2100 -n 17 -l tutorial`

**notice**

> For LESSONTYPE field, only `lecture / tutorial / laboratory` are accepted

Expected outcome:
~~~
____________________________________________________________
Event successfully added: 

    > Added 13 classes of Module: AC5001

____________________________________________________________
Event successfully added: 

    > Added 11 classes of Module: CS2100

~~~

### Deleting an event: `delete`
Delete a single event or all events from the schedule. Use –s to specify the events to delete, or –all to delete all events.

Format:
* `delete –s INDEX_OF_EVENT `
* `delete -all`

#### Examples of usage
1. Delete a single event: `delete –s 1`

2. Delete all events: `delete -all`

Expected outcome:
1. ~~~
	____________________________________________________________
	This event is deleted:
	
    	> [E] testing (2023/03/21 10:00 to 2023/03/21 10:00 not recurring)
	____________________________________________________________
	~~~

### List an event: `list`
Displays a list of all events that have been added to the schedule.

Format:
* List all events: `list`
* List timetable of specific week: `list -w WEEKNUM`

#### Examples of usage
* List all events: `list`
* List timetable of specific week: `list -w 7`

Expected outcome:

### Editing an event: `edit`
Edit an event that has been added to the schedule. Use –x to specify the attributes to edit.

Format: `edit -i INDEX_OF_EVENT –st STARTTIME –sd STARTDATE –et ENDTIME –ed ENDDATE -v VENUE -r x D/W`

**notice: **

> when Editing the event, User need to rewrite the complete time information including the parts that they do not what to change
>
> the format is the same as it in add command

* sd and ed must be of the format YYYY/MM/DD
* e, sd and st are compulsory fields
* ed and et are optional, but they must be written together if you use them
* other fields are optional.

#### Examples of usage
1. Edit the start time of an event: `edit –i 1 –st 16:00` 

2. Edit the start date, start time and end time of an event: `edit -i 1 –sd 2023/02/11 –st 08:00 –et 10:00 `

**notice: ** 

> Similar to add command, the app will also check whether there is any confliction between the new revised time and other events/classes with **full details of time information** if and only if the revised time information also have **starting date & time and ending date & time**
>
> The app will also only check confliction within the current semester. 

Expected outcome:
1. ~~~
	____________________________________________________________
	Time of event: event is changed to:
    	> 2023/04/01 16:00 not recurring
	____________________________________________________________
	~~~

2. ~~~
	____________________________________________________________
	Time of event: event is changed to: ed 2023/02/11
       > 2023/02/11 08:00 to 2023/02/11 10:00 not recurring

### Saving Data
NusPlanner data are saved to the hard drive automatically after the `bye` command to quit it. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file
Data for NUSPlanner is saved as a `.json` file. The path for the save file is `[JAR file location]/save.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing the data file.

🚧 **Warning**: If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, NUSPlanner will discard all data and load an empty data file at the next run.

### NUSMods Data
NusPlanner runs an offline version of the NUSMods API. The NUSMods data stored in NUSPlanner is correct as of **March 17, 2023**. 

## FAQ

**Q**: Why is a JAR file required?

**A**: Java ARchive, also known as JAR, is a container that groups multiple small files to enable efficient execution, which is similar to a ZIP file.


**Q**: Where can I report bugs I found while using NUSPlanner?

**A**: Our team of developers are always on the look-out to fix such bugs.
Please add a description of the bug found under our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-3/tp/issues).

## Command Summary
👉 Words in **CAPITAL LETTERS** are user input

👉 Each word is separated by only a **single whitespace**
