## Introduction

Our Expense Tracker CLI software ("ET" for short) allows users to create their own bookmakers and helps
them keep track of their expense based on category, time, amount, and currency.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `ET` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T13-2/tp/releases).
3. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tp.jar` command to run
   the application.
4. Enter your name when prompted in the command box and press enter.
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.

   Some example commands you can try:

    * `add amt/100 t/15-03-2023`: Add an expense entry with a value of SGD100.0 and a date of 15th March 2023 to the
      expense list.
    * `list`: List all expenses in the expense list.
    * `delete 1`: Delete the first entry in the expense list.
    * `sort D`: Sort the expenses by date.
    * `category food`: Find all expenses with food category.
    * `find 2.5`: Find all expenses with information of 2.5.

## Features

Format: `help`

### Adding an expense: `add`

Adds a new item to the list of expenses.

Format: `add amt/EXPENSE_AMOUNT t/TIME [cat/EXPENSE_CATEGORY] [cur/EXPENSE_CURRENCY]`

* The `EXPENSE_AMOUNT` must be an integer or decimal number without comma.
* The `TIME` must be in the DD-MM-YYYY format.
    * Future dates beyond today's date and Past dates before 1981 are invalid.
    * A warning will be shown if the input date has been adjusted as such a date may not exist for that particular
      month or year.
* The `EXPENSE_CATERGORY` can be any string that does not contain a whitespace symbol.
* The `EXPENSE_CURRENCY` has 22 currencies to choose from.
    * The list of available currencies are
      `SGD`, `EUR`, `GBP`, `USD`, `AUD`, `CAD`, `CNY`, `HKD`, `INR`, `IDR`, `JPY`, `KRW`, `MYR`, `TWD`, `NZD`, `PHP`,
      `QAR`, `SAR`, `CHF`, `THB`, `AED`, `VND`.
    * If the input currency is not found in the list of currencies
      available, the currency will default to SGD and a warning will be shown.
* The command parameters may be entered in any order. If multiple of the same parameter type is inputted, such as in
  `add amt/10 amt/100 t/11-11-2023` only the first parameter `amt/10` of its kind is used.
    * A warning will be shown if an
      invalid input type is specified.

Example of usage:

  is taken instead.
