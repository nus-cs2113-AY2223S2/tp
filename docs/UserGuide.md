## Introduction

With the transition to Canvas, the most important feature of LumiNUS’s deadline reminders is gone! **NUS To-Do List** aims to
bring an application to keep you aware of your deadlines and not miss them.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `NUS To-Do List` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T11-4/tp/releases/tag/v2.0).
3. Double-click the downloaded jar file or run `java -jar todolist.jar` in a terminal to start the program.

## Command Format

### Flags

- Words with a dash in front such as `-due` or `-email`, are considered as flags. Hence, [parameters](#parameters) like the description or tags cannot start with a dash.
- Each command has its own flags that need to be provided when running the command, some of which are mutually exclusive.
- A typo in a flag may cause it to be recognised as a parameter instead of a flag.
- You **cannot** repeat the same flag (`-edit abc -edit def`) for a command.
- Flags in square brackets `[]` are optional. (Do not include the brackets in the command)

### Parameters

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.
- Parameters cannot start with a dash `-`. For example, `add -random_name` is an invalid command.
- Flags and their parameters can be provided in any order after the command name and its parameter. For example, instead of `add DESCRIPTION -due DATE -email ADDRESS` you can also use `add DESCRIPTION -email ADDRESS -due DATE`.
- Unnecessary parameters for commands/flags that do not need them are ignored. For example, `exit 123` is equivalent to `exit`.

#### Restrictions

Given below is list of task attributes and their restrictions.

- `DESCRIPTION` The description of a task has no additional restrictions.
  - Examples: `Hello yah`, `pi is roughly 3`
- `DEADLINE` The date-time format is `dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm` or `dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm`.
  - When adding a task or editing a deadline, the `DEADLINE` cannot be in the past.
  - Examples: `14/03/2025 16:40`, `29/02/2024 06:39`
- `EMAIL_ADDRESS` must be of a valid email address format. (We do not check if the mailbox actually exists.)
  - Examples: `abc@def.com`, `this-is-valid-@too.com`
- `LIST_OF_TAGS` consists of one or more tags, separated by a space. A task cannot have multiple of the same tag.
  - Tags will be sorted in lexicographic order.
  - Examples: `difficult later 3.14`, `ALSO_A_TAG`
- `REPEAT_TIMES` must be an integer from 0 to 2147483647, and can only be used if the task also has a `DEADLINE`.
  - A copy of the task (with a new id) will be added every `REPEAT_FREQUENCY` days (defaults to 7) starting from the `DEADLINE` for `REPEAT_TIMES` times.
  - Examples: `37`, `0` (the default if not specified, equivalent to no recurrence)
- `PRIORITY_LEVEL` can be either 1, 2, or 3 (1: `Low`, 2: `Medium`, 3: `High`).
  - A priority of `0` (the default if not specified) can also be used to indicate no priority.

### Selecting tasks

Some commands can act on multiple tasks at once, which can be selected by providing a list of ids, OR one or more filters.

- `IDS` consists of one or more ids, separated by a space.
  - **IMPORTANT**: Ids (indicated with `ID:`) are different from the ordering number of a task (indicated with `#`). Each task has a unique, fixed id number used to select that specific task. Hence, ids do not reset without using the [`reset`](#reset-to-do-list-reset) command.
  - A command will not be executed if any of the provided ids are invalid (not in the task list).
  - Commands will be executed as if the list of ids is provided in increasing order.
  - Examples: `1 3 5`, `99`
- `FILTERS` can be one or more of the following:
  - Boolean filters
    - Replace `1` with `0` to invert the filter. 
    - `-done 1` filters completed tasks.
    - `-overdue 1` filters overdue (incomplete and past deadline) tasks.
    - `-rep 1` filters recurring (`REPEAT_TIMES` > 0) tasks.
  - Non-boolean filters
    - `-all` selects all tasks (this overrides all other filters).
    - `-desc STRING` filters tasks with descriptions containing the given string.
    - `-email EMAIL_ADDRESS` filters tasks with the given email address.
    - `-before DEADLINE` filters tasks with deadlines before the given deadline.
    - `-after DEADLINE` filters tasks with deadlines after the given deadline.
    - `-tags LIST_OF_TAGS` filters tasks that have all the given tags.
    - `-prio PRIORITY_LEVEL` filters tasks with the given priority level.
  - Example: `-done 0 -desc next` selects all incomplete tasks with `next` in their description. 

### Others

- Trailing, leading or consecutive spaces will be removed from commands.
- Certain commands that have no effect, such as deleting a non-existent attribute from a task or marking an already complete task, can still be executed anyway.

## Features

### Adding a task `add`

Adds a new task with the given attributes to your To-Do list.

Format: `add DESCRIPTION [-due DEADLINE] [-email EMAIL_ADDRESS] [-tags LIST_OF_TAGS] [-rep REPEAT_TIMES] [-prio PRIORITY_LEVEL]`

```

`add do math homework -email abc@def.com -prio 2 -tags difficult later 3.14` creates a task with the description `do math homework`, email address `abc@def.com`, priority level `Medium`, and the tags `3.14`, `difficult` and `later`.

### Show progress of tasks that are due this week `progress`

Displays the progress of and lists tasks that are due this week in To-Do list. Progress is shown in the form of a 
percentage (up to 2 decimal places) and a progress bar (where `=` denotes the proportion of tasks completed and `-` 
denotes the proportion of tasks that are left undone). Called automatically on startup.

- "this week" starts from Monday to Sunday of the current week.
- For example, if `progress` is used at any time on 06/04/2023 (Thursday), "this week" would include any time within 
03/04/2023 00:00 (Monday 12:00AM) to 09/04/2023 23:59 (Sunday 11:59PM).

Format: `progress`

Example of usage:

`progress`
```
You have completed 33.33% of the 3 tasks due this week!

### View/Edit configurable settings `config`

Displays/edits the current configuration for repeating tasks.

Format: `config` OR `config [-repfreq REPEAT_FREQUENCY] [-chkfreq CHECK_FREQUENCY]` OR `config -reset`

- `REPEAT_FREQUENCY` is in days and must be an integer from 1 to 2147483647.
  - Tasks will recur, creating a copy of themselves (with a new id) if it has been at least `REPEAT_FREQUENCY` since their deadline.
- `CHECK_FREQUENCY` is in minutes and must be an integer from 0 to 2147483647.
  - The program will check for recurring tasks on startup and when a command is executed if it has been at least `CHECK_FREQUENCY` minutes since the last check.
  - A `CHECK_FREQUENCY` of 0 will mean that the program will check for recurring tasks every time a command is executed.
- `config -reset` will cause configuration settings to be reset to the default (equivalent to `config -repfreq 7 -chkfreq 0`).
  - `-reset` will override `-repfreq` and `-chkfreq` if provided together.

Example of usage and output:
`config` displays the current configuration settings.
```
Here are the configuration settings for your system:
Repeating tasks every 7 days
Checking for repeating task every: 0 minutes
```
`config -chkfreq 5 -repfreq 3` sets tasks to repeat every 3 days and the check for recurring task to every 5 minutes.
```
Okay, I have changed the configuration to as follows:
Repeating tasks every 3 days
Checking for repeating task every: 5 minutes
```

### View help List `help`

Displays all possible commands/filters/sorts that can be used.

Format: `help [HELP_TYPE]`

- If `HELP_TYPE` is `filter`, the help message regarding filter options is displayed.
- If `HELP_TYPE` is `sort`, the help message regarding sorting options is displayed.
- If `HELP_TYPE` is anything else or not provided, the command help message is displayed.

Example of usage and output:

`help` will display the command help message.
```
Here is the list of commands that you can use:

## FAQ

**How do I transfer my data to another computer?**
- Your task list is saved in the generated `data.json` file, and configs are saved in the `config.json` file.
- Copy these files to the other computer and place them in the same location as the jar file for the program before running it.

**Can I edit my save/config file using a text editor?**
- Yes, but this is not recommended unless you know what you are doing.
- If your save/config file is invalidated and cannot be loaded, it will be copied to `invalid_data.json` and `invalid_config.json`, while your task list/config settings will be reset.

**Why was my recurring task details not updated with the original task?**
- The recurring tasks that are automatically added by the system are not linked to the original task.
- If you wish to change the task details for future recurring tasks, you may edit the latest task added by the system before the current deadline.
