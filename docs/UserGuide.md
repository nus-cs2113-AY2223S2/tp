## What is MoneyGoWhere?

MoneyGoWhere is a [*computer program*](#glossary) made by computing students from the National University of Singapore (NUS) that **helps you keep track of your sales**.

It works like the "cashier machine" that you have been using, but is even better! With MoneyGoWhere, **you can also see how
much money you make each day** and **what items you sell the most**.

**Now, you can make smarter business decisions, save time, and money**. _Steady_!

<hr style="width:90%;margin:50px auto;">

## Why we created MoneyGoWhere

MoneyGoWhere was created as we noticed most hawkers in the National University of Singapore (NUS) already had an existing [*Point-of-Sale*](#glossary) (POS) System, but most of them were not using them. After conducting interviews with the hawkers, we identified three main reasons why they were not using the system:

1. **The system is too slow** and becomes **unresponsive** too frequently.
2. **An internet connection is required** to use the POS system, but the Internet connection system in NUS frequently fails.
3. There is **no real incentive to use a system** that does not work, even if they have to **pay $200 a month** to use it.

After identifying these problems, our team of computing students has taken on the responsibility of creating an effective solution that addresses these issues. We aim to improve the lives of hawkers and enhance their businesses using technology.

In creating MoneyGoWhere, we had four goals in mind:
1. **To improve the business processes of hawkers**, so that they only need to focus on making food and can pay little attention to handling finances and order tracking, making their workflow more efficient. 
2. **To create a cheap solution**, increasing the profit of hawkers.
3. **To create a solution that does not require an internet connection,** providing around-the-clock availability and preventing downtime, especially when it matters most.
4. **To help support the digitalization efforts of the Government**, so that the older generation of hawkers may become more tech-savvy, within the comfort and familarity of their hawker stalls.

Upon completing the first version of our program, we have tested our system with one of our team member's parents, who are hawkers. They gave us honest feedback about MoneyGoWhere, and we have made adjustments according to their feedback.

When the second version of MoneyGoWhere was presented to them, they were more comfortable with our solution, and could confidently say that the goals of MoneyGoWhere were met.

We hope that you, as a hawker, can feel the same in using MoneyGoWhere!

## "I have problems right now, that's why I am reading the guide!" <a name="problems"></a>
### "But I cannot find what I am looking for, how now?"
We understand that using a new system can be confusing and frustrating. That is why we reduced our usage of technical words, and included examples in this guide.

We understand that you may be referencing this guide when business is booming - **you can already barely cope, and you don't have the time to search for instructions on how to use a feature.**

Don't worry! The guide is written in such a way that you can easily find what you are looking for.

There may be new words and phrases used in the guide that you may have never seen or heard of before. To make this guide easier to understand, our team has made sure all the "technical" words and phrases will be in blue, [*like this*]()! What this means is that if you click on them, it will lead you to a mini-dictionary of words at the bottom of the guide, called a [glossary](#glossary). These blue phrases are also known as [*hyperlinks*](#glossary). You can check out what it means in the glossary by clicking on it.

Additionally, *[these italicized hyperlinks](#glossary)* will bring you to our glossary at the bottom of the guide, while [non-italicized hyperlinks]() like these will bring you to the relevant sections of the guide.

If you cannot find what you are looking for, you may **call us at 9123 4567** so that we can help you as soon as possible.

## How to use the Guide 

This guide will bring you through:

1. How to use a [*Command Line Interface*](#glossary),
2. How to set up MoneyGoWhere, and
3. How to use our various [*commands*](#glossary) to track items, add orders, and generate statistic reports!

We will also provide some information on how [your data is saved](#frequently-asked-questions).
<!-- ^^ We can potentially omit this section -->

Before we begin, we want to let you know that this guide uses **three different colored blocks** and **icons** to indicate different things.

<blockquote style="background-color:#EAF5FF; color:#364253; border-color:#3399FF; padding: 2% 3%">
    üìñ This is a story block! Story blocks provide an example on when and how to use the many features of MoneyGoWhere. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote style="background-color:#FEEFD0; color:#364253; border-color:#877039; padding: 2% 3%">
    üí° These blocks contain information that you should take note of, or additional details that you might be interested in. Each block refers to a different point, so you may encounter two blocks right next to each other.

## Tutorial on Command Line Interface
<blockquote style="background-color:#FEEFD0; color:#364253; border-color:#877039; padding: 2% 3%">
    üí°  If you're already familiar with a <a href="#glossary"><i>Command Line Interface (CLI)</i></a>, otherwise known as a <a href="#glossary"><i>CLI</i></a>, that's great! Feel free to <a href="setting-up-moneygowhere"><i>move on to the next section</i></a> about setting up
MoneyGoWhere.

<br>

Otherwise, if you are new to the <a href="glossary"><i>CLI</i></a>, please continue reading this section for a simple introduction. The <a href="glossary"><i>CLI</i></a> is important in using MoneyGoWhere, so it is a good idea to know what you are looking at.
</blockquote>

Without further ado, let us begin exploring the [CLI](#glossary)! You may choose to follow the steps listed in the tutorial as we go along, so that you may get a better understanding.

### Opening a [*Terminal*](#glossary)

To begin, let us open a [*terminal*](#glossary) to view your [*CLI*](#glossary). You may enter `cmd` in your start menu and select the first [*option*](#glossary) that appears.
![](https://i.imgur.com/Ezt3rky.png)

### What's on a [*CLI*](#glossary)?

After opening the [*terminal*](#glossary), you should see a window similar to the one shown in the picture below.

![](https://imgur.com/FitjoRf.png)

For the sake of simplicity, going forward, we will be calling this window the [*CLI*](#glossary).

Now, let us break down the different parts of the [*CLI*](#glossary) for you!

From the very top, we can see the text `Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.22621.1413]`, followed by a [*Copyright*](#glossary) text. This may be different for every machine, so do not worry if what you see in your own [*CLI*](#glossary) is different.

![](https://imgur.com/IUTmjGe.png)

Next, we have the current directory. If you followed the [previous instruction](#opening-a-terminal), you should see `C:\Users\`, followed by your name on the screen, just like in this next screenshot. In this case, the name in the screenshot is `sean_`. This will look different in your own [*CLI*](#glossary), so do not panic if you see something different!

![](https://imgur.com/cRpNden.png)

A "current directory" is like a special folder that you are looking at right now on your computer. It is like a magic box that you can put things in or take things out of, but only if you're looking at that box right now. So if you want to find something or put something away, you need to make sure you're looking at the right magic box, or "current directory".

### What can I do on this?

You can type and run [*commands*](#glossary), one example of which is the command to launch MoneyGoWhere!

The following screenshot shows where you are able to type.

![](https://imgur.com/q6WTOE4.png)

To run the [*command*](#glossary) that you have just typed, you can press the `Enter` button on your keyboard.

However, if you entered `Hello Hawker, I can type here!` as shown in the previous screenshot, you will see an error message, stating that it is an invalid [command](#glossary) as shown in the next screenshot. This is because the sentence `Hello Hawker, I can type here!` is not a valid [command](#glossary).

![](https://imgur.com/zNtdks0.png)

One example of a valid [command](#glossary) is to change the name of the [CLI](#glossary) window. This can be done by using the `title` [command](#glossary).

We will show you how to use it soon, but first, notice how the `CLI` looks like now. In the screenshot below, the window is named `Command Prompt`.

![](https://imgur.com/WBuFLtU.png)

To change the name of the [CLI](#glossary) window from `Command Prompt` to `My favoruite application`, you can enter and run the [command](#glossary) `title My favourite application`.

If you have done it right, you should notice a change in the name of the window, like this!

![](https://imgur.com/RubluYJ.png)

You can also do things like delete or list the files in the current directory. However, this guide will not be covering these topics as they are not relevant to MoneyGoWhere. If you want to know more about [CLI](#glossary) and what other things you can do with them, [you may read up more about it from this article](https://blog.testproject.io/2021/03/30/a-beginners-guide-to-command-line-interface-cli/).

### Congratulations, you have completed the [CLI](#glossary) tutorial!

Now that you are familiar with how the [CLI](#glossary) works, you are now able to use MoneyGoWhere to its maximum potential! Let us now proceed to the next section, where we will guide you on how to set up MoneyGoWhere.

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

<hr style="width:90%;margin:50px auto;">

## Setting up MoneyGoWhere

1. Before installing and using MoneyGoWhere, do note that Java 11 is required. If you do not already have it installed,
   you can do so [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).
   * For Windows users, download the x64 Installer. Ensure you are on the "Windows" page and download the correct
     version as shown in the red boxes. Click `jdk-11.10.18_windows-x64_bin.exe` to begin your download.

     ![](https://i.imgur.com/ibRX7fQ.png)

     * For Mac users, download the ARM 64 DMG Installer. Ensure you are on the "macOS" page and download the correct
      version, in the red box. Click `jdk-11.0.18_macos-aarch64_bin.dmg` to begin your download

      ![](https://i.imgur.com/DGn8lrt.png)

2. Next, open the downloaded installer and follow the instructions on the installer to install Java 11.

3. After installing Java 11, [please download the latest release of the `MoneyGoWhere.jar` file](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/releases).
   Click on `MoneyGoWhere.jar` to automatically download the file. Ensure that it is the latest version (the one with the biggest number).

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/9qXdll7.png)

4. Find `MoneyGoWhere.jar` in your Downloads folder.

5. Open `cmd` and navigate to the folder where the `MoneyGoWhere.jar` file is. If you are unsure of how to do so, follow
   steps 6 to 8. Otherwise, you may skip ahead to step 8.

6. Open a [*terminal*](#glossary) by entering `cmd` in your start menu and select the first option that appears.
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ezt3rky.png)

7. Get the file path of `MoneyGoWhere.jar` in your computer. To easily do so, you can do the following:

   * For Windows users, right-click the file and select the "Properties" [*option*](#glossary). Then, copy the text
     under "Location".
     ![](https://i.imgur.com/bc72Izn.png)

   * For Mac users, right-click the file and select "Copy".
     ![](https://i.imgur.com/mKfwVrc.png)

8. In the CLI, navigate to the location of the folder by typing `cd `, type or paste the file path that you found from
   the previous step by pressing `CTRL` and `V` keys at the same time on your keyboard, then press enter.

   * For example, if the file path that you have is `C:\Users\natas\Downloads\Folder`, then you should
     enter `cd C:\Users\natas\Downloads\Folder` into the CLI.
    

9. Use the [*command*](#glossary) `java -jar MoneyGoWhere.jar` to launch MoneyGoWhere.
   If done correctly, you will see this on your first start up:
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/4K6rkQi.png)

   Note that returning users will not see the first two lines. Instead, they will see our logo and the remaining text.


10. When you are done using the app, enter `exit` to shut the application down or simply close the window by clicking on
    the `X` on the top right hand corner of the CLI.

## MoneyGoWhere [Commands](#glossary)

<blockquote style="background-color:#EAF5FF; color:#364253; border-color:#3399FF; padding: 2% 3%">
üìñ Meet <strong>John</strong>! He will be a character that is constantly referenced throughout the next few sections to better explain how the <a href="#glossary"><i>commands</i></a> work. John is an aspiring hawker, and plans on running a new stall at The Deck in NUS.

</blockquote>

<blockquote style="background-color:#FEEFD0; color:#364253; border-color:#877039; padding: 2% 3%">
üí° Even though the <strong>New User</strong> and <strong>Experienced User</strong> <a href="#glossary"><i>command</i></a> are entered into the application slightly differently, they both work exactly the same.

</blockquote>

<hr style="width:90%;margin:50px auto;">

## Style Features

For the following sections, all examples on how to run [*commands*](#glossary) are shown through pictures. There are four
things
to take note of:

1. Standard text printed by the application is written in **white**.
2. User input is signified and is written in <text style="color:#88B3F6"><strong>blue</strong></text>.
3. Success messages and examples of expected output is written in <text  style="color:#7ED321"><strong>green</strong></text>.
4. Error messages are written in <text style="color:#F25569"><strong>red</strong></text>.

**When you use the application, the text on your screen will be in white.**

We have chosen to color-code our examples to make it easier for you to follow along and tell apart different parts of
the examples.

Here is an example of what you can expect to see in this Guide.

![](https://i.imgur.com/MT5YgYP.png)

For those reading the **New User** sections, do also note the following:

1. At any point, if you wish to exit from the [*command*](#glossary), you can do so with `/cancel`

For those reading the **Experienced User** sections, do also note the following:

1. Any words surrounded by `<>`, such as `<price>` are for you to fill in.
2. [*Options*](#glossary) that are surrounded by `{}`, such as `{-n "<name>"}` are optional.
3. All values have to be accompanied by [*options*](#glossary) (begins with `-`, such as `-n` or `--price`). [*Commands*](#glossary) such
   as `/deleteitem delete -i 10` will be an invalid [*command*](#glossary).

## Item Features

Before you start taking orders, you will need to set up your menu. This must be done at least once.

Depending on the size of your menu, you may need to spend quite a bit of time to add all of your menu items into
MoneyGoWhere. It is important that you do this before opening shop for the day, to ensure that your business can be run
without any disruptions.

You may continue to add new items to the menu at any point of time.
<!--This should be a one-time process, but you can always add more items or remove old items at any point.-->

## Item Table of Contents

* [Add an Item](#add-an-item)
* [List all Items](#list-all-items)
* [Delete an Item](#delete-an-item)
* [Update an Item](#update-an-item)
* [Find an Item](#find-an-item)

## Add an Item

If you need to add an item to the menu, you can use this [*command*](#glossary). To add an item, you will need the
item's
name and price.

<h3> <strong>For New Users </strong></h3>

This example will show you how to add an item step-by-step.

1. John starts the application for the first time. He sees the greeting and knows that he set up the application
   correctly. Now, he wants to add **White Chicken Rice**, which costs **$4.50** to the menu.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/YBkgvEQ.png)

2. He sees that he is successful and feels happy that the application is easy to use. Now, he wants to add **Egg**,
   which costs **$0.80** to the menu.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/qeTaDFj.png)

3. Lastly, John uses [`listitem`](#list-all-items) to check that he has added the items correctly.

</blockquote>

**[*Command*](#glossary) Format**

These are the different [*command*](#glossary) formats that are accepted when adding a new item into the menu.

```text
/additem --name "<item name>" --price <price>
```

```text
/additem -n "<item name>" -p <price>
```

You may also interchange the location of the [*options*](#glossary) in the [*commands*](#glossary).

For example, the following [*command*](#glossary) is also valid.

```text
/additem  -p <price> -n "<item name>"
```

This example below will show you how to add an item in a single [*command*](#glossary).

1. John starts the application for the first time. He sees the greeting and knows that he set up the application
   correctly. Now, he wants to add **White Chicken Rice**, which costs **$4.50** to the menu.

**1. Name already exists**

MoneyGoWhere does not allow for multiple items with the same name. If you try to put in an item with the same name, you
will get the following error.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ULSYB6F.png)

**Solution:** Use a different name.


**2. Price has more than two [*decimal places*](#glossary)**

MoneyGoWhere does not allow you to enter a number with more than two [*decimal places*](#glossary). This is because
there
are no such denominations in real life.

![](https://i.imgur.com/bGhE59B.png)

**Solution:** Limit the price to 2 decimal points.

<h3> For New Users </h3>

1. John enters the [command](#glossary) `addorder`.

   He forgets the [*index*](#glossary) of "Roast Chicken Rice", and instead chooses to search by name instead of [*index*](#glossary). Take note that
   the item name must be entered within `""` marks.

   Next, he enters the quantity and states that he has no more items to add. As the customer pays with cash, John then
   enters the payment information.

2. For the second customer, John repeats the same process.

   He enters the [*command*](#glossary), then the [*index*](#glossary) of "White Chicken Rice" and indicates the quantity.

   He repeats the same process for adding "Egg" to the order, then completes the process by entering the payment
   details.

<h3> For Experienced Users </h3>

**[*Command*](#glossary) Format**

There are two main ways in which an order can be entered using a single `/addorder` [*command*](#glossary). Listed below are the
acceptable formats of the `/addorder` [*command*](#glossary).

1. To add a single item into an order, using the item [*index*](#glossary), by using the item name, or by using part of
   the item name,
   use any of these formats:
    ```text
    /addorder -i <index> -q <quantity>
    ```
    ```text
    /addorder --item <index> -q <quantity>
    ```
    ```text
    /addorder -i "<name>" --quantity <quantity>
    ``` 

    ```text
    /addorder --item "<name>" --quantity <quantity>
    ```
   If the quantity is not specified, it will be set to 1.

2. To add multiple items into an order using the item [*indexes*](#glossary), by using the item names, or by using part
   of the item
   names, use any of these formats:
    ```text
    /addorder -I [<index>:<quantity>,"<name>":<quantity>,...]
    ```
    ```text
    /addorder --items [<index>:<quantity>,"<name>":<quantity>,...]
    ```

<blockquote style="background-color:#FEEFD0; color:#364253; border-color:#877039; padding: 2% 3%">
    üí° To use the <a href="#glossary"><i>command</i></a> in this manner, remember to add a <code>/</code> before the <a href="#glossary"><i>command</i></a>, such as <code>/addorder</code>.
</blockquote>

Here is an example of how the `/addorder` [*command*](#glossary) may be used to add orders.

1. John enters the [*command*](#glossary) `/addorder`. He uses the [*index*](#glossary) of "Roast Chicken Rice", and enters the
   quantity.

   As his customer pays with cash, John then enters the payment information with the `/pay` [*command*](#glossary) and by entering the
   customer's payment details based on the instructions from the program.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/QCkbbcR.png)

2. For the second customer, John temporarily forgets the [*index*](#glossary) of "White Chicken Rice".

   As he knows there is only one item with "White Chicken" in the name, he enters that as the first item, along with the
   quantity.

   Then, he uses the [*index*](#glossary) of "Egg", along with the quantity. After adding both items, he proceeds to
   enter the payment.

   This time, the customer chose to pay by card, which John enters into the application to reflect that mode of payment.

**Solution:** Ensure that the customer pays more than or the exact cost of the order.

**2. Paying with card**

When your customers pay with their card, entering an amount different from the subtotal will be rejected.

## Refund an Order

Did you enter the wrong item, or did a customer change their mind after paying for an item?

Don't worry! If the order has not yet been served or if you allow it, you can use this [*command*](#glossary) to mark an order as
refunded.

Don't worry if you find yourself still confused by the format. We admit, it is pretty complex. So, let's break it down:

**Rank vs Sale**

Of the two, only one can be present in your [*command*](#glossary).

* When generating your report, you can choose between the [*options*](#glossary) `rank` or `sale`.
   * Rank orders the items on your menu based on either `sales` (monetary income) or `popular` (quantity ordered).
   * Meanwhile, Sale shows your income, either on a `daily` basis or `monthly` basis.

**Year vs From/To**

Of the two, only one can be present in your [*command*](#glossary).

* You can choose which dates to generate the report.
   * Year takes the format `YYYY`
   * From/To takes the format `DD/MM/YYYY`

   enters `2023` for the `year` [*option*](#glossary).

   Note that the remaining months have been removed as they are all empty.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: I'm switching to a new laptop. Do I need to re-enter all the items on my menu? And what about my transactions?**

**A:** Don't worry! At MoneyGoWhere, we understand that you may change the laptop you use. When changing to a new
laptop, simply copy the entire folder! This way, the application and all your data will stay the same across devices.

**Q: Where is my save file?**

**A:** Your menu and transaction list are stored in a folder called `datastore`. Inside it, you should see two
files: `menu.json` and `orders.json`. However, all changes to your data should be made through the application itself,
as we are not liable for any data loss as a result of [*tampering*](#glossary) with those files.
