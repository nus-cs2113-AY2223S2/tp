### Adding an event: `add`
Adds an event to the schedule. Assuming x is an switch. Use –x to specify the attributes to edit.

Format: `add –e EVENTNAME –st STARTTIME –sd STARTDATE –et ENDTIME –ed ENDDATE -v VENUE -r RECURRING TIME`
* sd and ed must be of the format YYYY/MM/DD
* e, sd and st are compulsory fields
* ed and et are optional, but they must be written together if you use them
* v is optional
* r is optional, the format is x D/ x W, which means the event will happen in every x day/x week.

#### Examples of usage
1. Add event that starts and ends on different days: `add -e Career Fair -st 14:00 -sd 2023/02/10 -et 16:00 -ed 2023/02/11`
2. Add event that happens every week: `add -e collect mails -st 08:00 -sd 2023/02/10 -et 08:10 -ed 2023/02/10 -r 1 W`

**Notice:** 

> date/time formats like 8:00 or 2023/4/1 are not accepted. The format should be strictly	`two digits`:`two digits`	(08:00 and 2023/04/01 in this case).


Expected outcome:

1. ~~~
	____________________________________________________________
	Event successfully added: 00 -sd 2023/02/10 -et 16:00 -ed 2023/02/11

**Confliction Checking: ** 

- NUSPlanner will only check for conflicts between events and classes that have **starting date & time and ending date & time, within the time period of selected semester.**
- Users need to check themselves whether the events will clash with each other during vacation periods.


### Adding a module: `add`
Adds a module to the schedule. Assuming x is an switch. Use –x to specify the attributes to edit.

Format: `add –m MODULECODE -n CLASSNUMBER -l LESSONTYPE`
* All fields are compulsory

#### Examples of usage
* Add a lecture of module: `add -m AC5001 -n 1 -l lecture`
* Add a tutorial of module: `add -m CS2100 -n 11 -l tutorial`

#### How to find the correct `MODULECODE`, `CLASSNUMBER` and `LESSONTYPE`?
* Head over to [NUSMods](www.nusmods.com)
* Find the class and slot that you want
* For example, user wants to take these 3 slots:
![NUSModsEG.png](NUSModsEG.png)
> `MODULECODE`: Module code
> 
>`CLASSNUMBER`: Number that is allocated to class. It is in this format: [X]
> 
>`LESSONTYPE`: Either lecture, tutorial or laboratory and is stated before `CLASSNUMBER`
* Commands used for this case are
`add -m CS2100 -n 01 -l tutorial`, `add -m CS2100 -n 02 -l laboratory` and `add -m CS2100 -l lecture`
* Please type out your commands and ensure your spelling is accurate
* Copying and pasting commands from the user guide may cause some issues due to formatting

### Editing an event: `edit`
Edit an event that has been added to the schedule. Use –x to specify the attributes to edit.

Format: `edit -i INDEX_OF_EVENT –st STARTTIME –sd STARTDATE –et ENDTIME –ed ENDDATE -v VENUE -r x D/W`

**notice: **

> when Editing the event, User need to rewrite the complete time information including the parts that they do not what to change
>
> the format is the same as it in add command

* sd and ed must be of the format YYYY/MM/DD
* e, sd and st are compulsory fields
* ed and et are optional, but they must be written together if you use them
* other fields are optional.

#### Examples of usage
1. Edit the start time of an event: `edit –i 1 –st 16:00` 

2. Edit the start date, start time and end time of an event: `edit -i 1 –sd 2023/02/11 –st 08:00 –et 10:00 `

**notice: ** 

> Similar to add command, the app will also check whether there is any confliction between the new revised time and other events/classes with **full details of time information** if and only if the revised time information also have **starting date & time and ending date & time**
>
> The app will also only check confliction within the current semester. 

Expected outcome:
1. ~~~
	____________________________________________________________
	Time of event: event is changed to:
    	> 2023/04/01 16:00 not recurring
	____________________________________________________________

2. ~~~
	____________________________________________________________
	Time of event: event is changed to: ed 2023/02/11
       > 2023/02/11 08:00 to 2023/02/11 10:00 not recurring

### Saving Data
NusPlanner data are saved to the hard drive automatically after the `bye` command to quit it. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file
Data for NUSPlanner is saved as a `.json` file. The path for the save file is `[JAR file location]/save.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing the data file.

🚧 **Warning**: If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, NUSPlanner will discard all data and load an empty data file at the next run.

### NUSMods Data
NusPlanner runs an offline version of the NUSMods API. The NUSMods data stored in NUSPlanner is correct as of **March 17, 2023**. 

## FAQ

**Q**: Why is a JAR file required?

**A**: Java ARchive, also known as JAR, is a container that groups multiple small files to enable efficient execution, which is similar to a ZIP file.


**Q**: Where can I report bugs I found while using NUSPlanner?

**A**: Our team of developers are always on the look-out to fix such bugs.
Please add a description of the bug found under our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-3/tp/issues).

## Command Summary
👉 Words in **CAPITAL LETTERS** are user input

👉 Each word is separated by only a **single whitespace**
