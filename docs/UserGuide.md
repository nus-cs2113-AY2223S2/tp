## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F10-1/tp/releases).
3. Copy the JAR file to the folder you wish to use as the Inka home folder -- your data will be saved here!
4. Open the JAR file, either by clicking or running `java -jar Inka.jar`. A command line interface should appear:

![Inka interface](img/quick-start.png)

Enjoy your revision!

### Use Case

Cards that you add to Inka can be organized using tags, and decks can be flexibly constructed either by adding *
*individual cards** and/or multiple cards with the **same tag**.

For example, suppose you had the following cards:

|            | **Question**                 | **Answer**                  | **Tags**                 |
|------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Card 1** | What does UML stand for?     | Unified Markup Language     | _cs2113-wk8_             |
| **Card 2** | What is my favourite module? | CS2113                      | _cs2113-wk1, freq-wrong_ |
| **Card 3** | Is P = NP?                   | Most definitely not         | _freq-wrong_             |
| **Card 4** | What does OOP stand for?     | Object-Oriented Programming | _cs2113-wk8_             |

You might organize your cards in the following fashion:

- Adding the `cs2113-wk1` and `cs2113-wk8` tags to group together cards of similar topics
- Adding the `freq-wrong` tag to cards that you wish to review more frequently

This allows you to create the following decks easily:

| **Deck Name**    | **Added Card(s)** | **Added Tag(s)**         | **Cards in Deck** |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| CS2113           | -                 | _cs2113-wk1, cs2113-wk8_ | Cards 1, 2, 4     |
| Frequently-Wrong | -                 | _freq-wrong_             | Cards 2, 3        |
| Acronyms         | Card 3            | _cs2113-wk8_             | Cards 1, 3, 4     |

## Usage of flags

Inka's commands makes substantial use of flags to indicate certain parameters that users enter. In this guide, we will
adopt the following syntax similar to many Unix CLI tools:

- Required arguments are indicated by `-f ARG`
- Optional arguments are indicated by `[-f ARG]`
- Mutually exclusive required arguments are `{-a ARG | -b ARG}`
- Mutually exclusive optional arguments are `[-a ARG | -b ARG]`

There will be many instances where users have to identify a card, tag or deck in a command. For ease of use, there are
multiple ways to select a card or tag:

- Selecting a card
    - By UUID: `-c CARD_UUID`
    - By index: `-i CARD_INDEX`:
- Selecting a tag
    - By tag name: `-t TAG_NAME`
    - By index: `-x TAG_INDEX`
- Selecting a deck
    - Only by deck name: `-d DECK_NAME`

For instance, in `card untag` command, since users are required to specify a card and a tag, the format of syntax in the
documentation below will be written as:

`card untag {-c CARD_UUID | -i CARD_INDEX} {-t TAG_NAME | -x TAG_INDEX}`

The user can then specify the card of their choice **either** via the card's UUID or index, and similarly for the tag.
For more information, refer to `card list`, `tag list` or `deck list`.

## Features

### Adding a card

`card add -q QUESTION -a ANSWER`

Adds a new Card with its question and answer.

***Lists of flags (in any order)*** :

- `-q` followed by a String representing the question
- `-a` followed by a String representing the answer

Users can refer to this [section](#usage-of-flags) to recap on how the flag works.

While there is no restriction on then length of the question/answer that the user can enter, these will be truncated in
the display of `card list` command if longer than 50 characters. The full version can be viewed using the `card view`
command below.

***Example of usage:***

`card add -q how do i use this command? -a by referring to this user guide`

***Sample Output :***

```
That's a good question for revision later!
You now have 4 questions in the bank.
```

---
**Note:** To avoid confusion, `card add` does not support the question/answer being "-q" or "-a". If the user so wishes
to use such characters in their question/answer, it is recommended that they provide it as such:

```
# Do not do this!
card add -q What is the flag for question? -a -q

# Instead, do this
card add -q What is the flag for question? -a "-q"
```

### Listing all cards

`card list`

List all existing cards in Inka.

***Lists of flags (in any order)*** :

- ***NONE***

***Sample output:***

```
Here is a list of your cards :

	1.      [1ddd9a67-f56c-4914-99c0-2f90c580f0e9]

```

In `1.    [1ddd9a67-f56c-4914-99c0-2f90c580f0e9]` above, the `1` refers the card index and the
`1ddd9a67-f56c-4914-99c0-2f90c580f0e9` refers the UUID of the card. User can choose whether to refer to the card by UUID
or card index.

### Deleting a card

### Run the Deck

`deck run -d DECK_NAME`

In order to use `deck run`, the following key pointers must be kept in mind:

1. Once you type the command in, the question would be printed first. Do note that **you are only required to hit press
   enter. Pressing enter would inform the program to display the answer**
2. If you wish to exit, the type _exit_, and the program should jump out of `run mode` and bring you back to normal
   functioning
3. If a user were to type anything, Inka would prompt the user not to type anything and display the answer.

Here are some examples:

- _Example where the user only presses an enter!_

```
> deck run -d physicsdeck
	Q: What is the formula of GPE?

	A: E = mgh

	Q: How efficient is binary search?

	A: O(log n)

	Q: What is the formula of force?

	A: F = ma

```

- _Example where the user wishes to exit_:

```
> deck run -d physicsdeck
	Q: What is the formula of GPE?

	A: E =mgh

	Q: How efficient is binary search?
exit
Exiting run mode!

```

- _Example where the user enters something other than exit or enter_:

```
> deck run -d physicsdeck
	Q: What is the formula of GPE?
asgsdfgsfdgsdfg
There is no need to input any characters!
Just hitting enter is sufficient to show the answer! Anyway, here is the answer!

	A: E =  mgh

	Q: How efficient is binary search?
sfgsdfgsdfgsdfg
There is no need to input any characters!
Just hitting enter is sufficient to show the answer! Anyway, here is the answer!

	A: O(log n)

	Q: What is the formula of force?
dfgsdfgsdfgsdfgsdfg
There is no need to input any characters!
Just hitting enter is sufficient to show the answer! Anyway, here is the answer!

	A: F = ma
```

---

### Exit the program

User simply needs to run `bye`

Sample output :

```
 ____  _  _  ____    _   
(  _ \( \/ )(  __)  / \  
 ) _ ( )  /  ) _)   \_/  
(____/(__/  (____)  (_) 

 Bye! All the best for your exams man!!!
```

## FAQ

**Q**: Will deleting a card from a tag delete it from multiple decks?

**A**: Deleting a card from a tag deletes the card from all decks that contain its tag.

**Q**: Can I modify savedata.json to manually add cards?

**A**: No, data as the card ID is generated by the app. Please add cards through the app instead.

**Q**: Can I add multiple cards at the same time?

**A**: No, please add them one at a time using `card add`

**Q**: Can I transfer my cards to another computer?

**A**: You do so by following these steps:

1. Export the deck as a Json file using the command "export". It may take a moment for the file to be written, so please
   wait, or try refreshing your file explorer!
2. Navigate to the directory of your Inka installation.
3. The file will be named savedata.json. Copy this file.
4. Paste this file in the Inka's directory in the new computer

Your file will be loaded the next time you run Inka!
