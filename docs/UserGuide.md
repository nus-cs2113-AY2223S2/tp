## Introduction

PocketPal is an expense tracking command line application that allows users to record their expenses in different
categories. Subsequently, users can monitor their expenses within a specified timeframe, or price range. They may also
monitor expenses in certain categories. This makes it easier for users to plan their budgets and make better financial
decisions.

> The table below provides a summary of all the currently supported features in PocketPal.
> More detailed explanations on the usage of the commands are provided as well.

## Features

This user guide adopts the following conventions for the command-line syntax:

+ Angle brackets (`<>`) indicate that the enclosed arguments are mandatory.
+ Square brackets (`[]`) indicate that the enclosed arguments are optional.
+ Ellipsis (`...`) indicate that the preceding argument can be repeated several times in one command.
+ Pipe or vertical line (`|`) indicates a choice within an argument. You can select either one of them, but cannot
  select more than one.

**IMPORTANT NOTES**

- All arguments starting with a dash (`-`) will be treated as options. This includes negative integers, which would trigger unknown options exception

- For all specified options, only the arguments that follow the first declaration will be parsed. **i.e. any
  subsequent re-declarations of the same option will be ignored.**<br>For example, for the following
  input:<br>`/view -c food -c clothing`<br>Only entries in the `food` category will be listed.

If you face any problems, do visit the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions) segment!
