> **Notes about command format**
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` (such as `QUANTITY`) indicate that an input is expected from the user.
>   * E.g. in `add QUANTITY /of NAME`, `QUANTITY` and `NAME` are parameters which can be used as `add 2 /of shoes`.
> * The `/` in `/of` is necessary for `of` to be recognised as a keyword.
> * `NAME` is a case-sensitive input.
> * The order of parameters has to be strictly followed. 
>   * Not following the given order would result in error messages or incorrect behaviour.
> * Leading and trailing spaces for each input will be ignored.
> * Extraneous parameters will be ignored for commands that do not take in parameters.
>   * For example, `deletelist abc123` will be interpreted as `deletelist`.
> * For more information on integers, please read this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer).

## <span style="color:#00A36C">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</span>

**Q**: I keep getting a message that says the command is invalid, why? 

**A**: Please check that there are no typos in the command. To check the correct spelling of the commands, please type `help` and hit enter.


**Q**: I am following the suggested input, why is it still giving me an error?

**A**: For command inputs that have item quantity and item index, the / character is necessary before the of (e.g. `pack 1 /of 1` is valid but `pack 1 of 1` is not)


**Q**: Why are some commands affected by extra random inputs before or after the full command while others aren't?

**A**: The commands that are not affected by extra inputs are those that have no variables (e.g. `list`, `listunpacked`, `bye`, and `help`)


**Q**: Why does `editquantity` command give me an error for a positive integer quantity?

**A**: Your new input quantity may be considered invalid as it is smaller than the current packed amount of the item. (You cannot set the total quantity to be less than what is currently packed)


**Q**: Why does my list have duplicate items?

**A**: Item names are caps sensitive, you could have accidentally input two items with the same name but differing in capitalisation. 


**Q**: Why is the list indexes for `find` command not sequential?

**A**: The index printed for `find` comes from the full packing list which can be retrieved from `list` command.
