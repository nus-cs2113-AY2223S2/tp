------------------------------------------------------------
```
You are now in the `main` session of `WellNUS+`. Access our features by issuing a feature command(described in later 
sections). Issue the `help` command to see the list of feature commands available.

# Overview of WellNUS++

WellNUS++ comes with a variety of features to help you enhance your overall wellness in NUS! The features are Atomic
Habit, Self Reflection, Focus Timer and Gamification.

![WellNUS++ Structure Overview](diagrams/WellNusStructure.png)<br/>

Upon running our application jar, users first start in the `main` session. From here, users can navigate to different 
features using the commands `hb`, `ft`, `reflect` and `gamif`, which takes them to the feature-specific session(see 
later sections for details about each feature session).

Each feature session provides its own set of commands for users to explore. Return to the `main` session
using the `home` command. 

Issue `help` in any session to find out what commands are available to you.

Exit `WellNUS++` by issuing the `exit` command(**only** available in the `main` session).

# Features

<!-- @@author nichyjt -->

## Command Format

A command has the general structure:

```
mainCommand PAYLOAD_0 --argument1 PAYLOAD_1 --argument2 PAYLOAD_2
```

Command syntax:

* Words in **UPPER_CASE** are the payloads to be supplied by the user.  
  e.g. in `add --name NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used in this way: `add --name John Doe`
* Items in square brackets are **optional**.  
  e.g in `add --name NAME  [--tag TAG]`, the command can be used in two ways:
    * `add --name John Doe --tag friend`, or
    * `add --name John Doe`
    * Payloads may also be optional if they are wrapped in `[]`
* Arguments can be in any order.  
  e.g. Consider `--name NAME --phone PHONE_NUMBER`.  
  `--phone PHONE_NUMBER --name NAME` is a valid set of arguments.
* The `mainCommand` and `argument` are case insensitive.  
  e.g. `aDD --nAmE NAME` is equivalent to `add --name NAME`

## `hb` - Accessing atomic habit feature

Atomic habit feature allows users to keep track of the daily habits they wish to develop for better self improvement.

Format: `hb`<br>

Example of usage:<br>

`hb`

Expected outcome:

```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    _  _             _      _  _      _    _ _      
   /_\| |_ ___ _ __ (_)__  | || |__ _| |__(_) |_ ___
  / _ \  _/ _ \ '  \| / _| | __ / _` | '_ \ |  _(_-<
 /_/ \_\__\___/_|_|_|_\__| |_||_\__,_|_.__/_|\__/__/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Welcome to WellNUS++ Atomic Habits section!
    Track and inculcate good habits into your life with us!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

### `add` - Add new atomic habit

Adds an atomic habit to be tracked by WellNUS++ when accessing atomic habit feature.
Count of the habit will be initialised to 0.

Format: `add --name ATOMIC_HABIT_NAME`

* `ATOMIC_HABIT_NAME` is used to uniquely identify each habit(unique and not null). This means habits with
  the same `ATOMIC_HABIT_NAME` are not allowed, and a duplicate habit with the same `ATOMIC_HABIT_NAME`
  cannot be added later.

Example of usage:

`add --name make bed every morning`

Expected outcome:

```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Yay! You have added a new habit:
    'make bed every morning' was successfully added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

### `list` - List all atomic habit

Shows a list of all atomic habits.

Format: `list`

Example of usage:

`list`

Expected outcome:

```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Here is the current accumulation of your atomic habits!
    Keep up the good work and you will develop a helpful habit in no time
    1.Make Bed every morning [0]
    2.Read for at least 30 minutes every day [3]
    3.Avoid checking phone for the first hour after waking up [2]
    ... 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

### `update` - Update an atomic habit

Increment the number of times that an atomic habit has been carried out. <br>
Decrement the atomic habits if you wrongly incremented.

Format: `update --id HABIT_INDEX [--by NUMBER_TO_CHANGE]`

* (**Optional**) Step 1: You are _recommended_ to list the current habits using the command `list`
* Step 2: Select the habit to update by entering the index number of the habit `HABIT_INDEX` according to index of the
  list output. <br>
  The user can specify the number to change for the habit count via `NUMBER_TO_CHANGE`. <br>
  The **default** behaviour is to increment the behaviour by 1. <br> To decrement the habit count, enter a negative
  number
  instead(see 'Example of usage 2' below).

Note: '+' in front of `NUMBER_TO_CHANGE` parameter is not necessary when incrementing.
For example, to increment index 1 by 2 counts, issue `update --id 1 --by 2`,
**_not_** `update --id 1 --by +2`. See 'Example of usage 1' below.

Example of usage 1:

* `list` (_Optional_, done here to show change in habit count)
* `update --id 1 --by 2`

Expected outcome 1:

```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Here is the current accumulation of your atomic habits!
    Keep up the good work and you will develop a helpful habit in no time
    1. Make bed every morning [5]
    2. Read for at least 30 minutes every day [3] 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The following habit has been incremented! Keep up the good work!
    1. Make bed every morning [7]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Example of usage 2:

* `list` (_Optional_, done here to show change in habit count)
* `update --id 1 --by -2`

Expected outcome 2:

```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Here is the current accumulation of your atomic habits!
    Keep up the good work and you will develop a helpful habit in no time
    1.Make bed every morning [7]
    2.Read for at least 30 minutes every day [3]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The following habit has been decremented.
    1.Make bed every morning [5]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

### `delete` - Delete an atomic habit

Delete an atomic habit that is not relevant anymore.

Format: `delete --id HABIT_INDEX`

* (**Optional**) Step 1: List the current habits using command `list`

review the previous set before liking them, and use the displayed index to choose questions.
Index parameter is limited to integer 1-5 as only 5 questions will be generated in every random set.

Example of usage:

`like 1`

Expected output:

```

## `ft` - Accessing Focus Timer Feature

Our Focus Timer feature allows users to be productive by setting a configurable work-break timer, inspired by
the Pomodoro technique. When each timer ends, a `beep` is played to alert the user that the current timer countdown is 
over.

Summary of Pomodoro Technique: Repeated sessions of work followed by break to ensure maximum productivity during the
work cycle and allow one to relax sufficiently during the break cycle before working again. Longer breaks are taken
after a few consecutive sessions(**2** by default in our app). Find out more about the technique on the 
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

**Command input is disabled when timer is counting down the last 10 seconds.**

Format: `ft`<br>

Example of usage:<br>

`ft`

Expected outcome:

```
************************************************************
    Welcome to Focus Timer.
    Start a focus session with `start`, or `config` the session first!
************************************************************
```

<!--@@author YongbinWang-->

### `start` - Start Session

Ask WellNUS++ to start the focus session consisting of work and break cycles.

`start` can only be used when you first enter Focus, after a session has ended or after a session has been `stop`.

Format: `start`

Example of usage:

`start`

Expected outcome:

```
************************************************************
    Your session has started. All the best!
************************************************************
************************************************************
    Task Cycle: Do your task now!
************************************************************
```

### `pause` - Pause session

Ask WellNUS++ to pause the focus session which pauses the current countdown timer.

`pause` can only be used when the timer is counting down.

Format: `pause`

Example of usage:

`pause`

Expected outcome:

```
************************************************************
    Timer paused at: 0:54
************************************************************
```

### `resume` - Resume session

Ask WellNUS++ to resume the focus session which continues the current countdown timer.

`resume` can only be used when the timer has been paused.

Format: `resume`

Example of usage:

`resume`

Expected outcome:

```
************************************************************
    Timer resumed at: 0:54
************************************************************
```

### `check` - Check time

Ask WellNUS++ to display the current time of the timer for users to check time remaining.

`check` can be used whenever during the ongoing session. If the timer has not `start`, is `stop` or reached 0 and is
waiting for the `next` command, check will not run.

Format: `check`

Example of usage:

`check`

Expected outcome:

```
************************************************************
    Time left: 0:57
************************************************************
```

### `next` - Next timer

Ask WellNUS++ to start the next work or break iteration of the focus session.

`next` can only be used when a work or break timer has ended, and a prompt to proceed to the next timer is displayed.

Format: `next`

Example of usage:

`next`

Expected outcome (if the next timer is a work timer):

```
************************************************************
    Task Cycle: Do your task now!
************************************************************
```

Expected outcome (if the next timer is a break timer):

```
************************************************************
    Break Cycle: Take a breather!
************************************************************
```

### `stop` - Stop session

Ask WellNUS++ to stop the focus session.

`stop` can only be used after the session has started.

Format: `stop`

Example of usage:

`stop`

Expected outcome:

```
************************************************************
    Your focus session has ended.
    To start a new session, `start` it up!
    You can also configure the session to your liking with `config`!
************************************************************
```

* Give a detailed explanation of the parameters and subcommands for the given command `COMMAND_TO_CHECK`

Example of usage 1:

`help`

Expected outcome:

```
************************************************************
    ft - Focus Timer - Set a configurable 'Pomodoro' timer with work and rest cycles to keep yourself focused and productive!
    Input `help` to see all available commands.
    Input `help [command-to-check]` to get usage help for a specific command.

### `config` - Configure the Timer

Configures the focus timer's settings.
The number of work-break cycles, work length and break length can be configured.
When leaving `ft`, the configuration will be reset to the default values.

Format: `config [--cycle NUM_OF_CYCLE --work WORK_TIME --break BREAK_TIME --longbreak LONG_BREAK_TIME]`

* If no arguments are given, `config` prints out the current session settings
* `NUM_OF_CYCLE` is an **integer** that is `>= 2`
* `WORK_TIME, BREAK_TIME, LONG_BREAK_TIME` are **integers** that are all `>= 1`

**Configuation Limits**

* `LONG_BREAK_TIME` should be greater or equal to `BREAK_TIME`
* `WORK_TIME, BREAK_TIME, LONG_BREAK_TIME` have an upper limit of 60
* `NUM_CYCLE` has an upper limit of 5

Why limit to 60 mins and 5 cycles?
[Studies have shown](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/slc/learning/exam-prep/efficient-effective-study)
that an hour of studying/task at a time is the most optimal. 5 cycles has been set to prevent guard you against
excessive working. Anything higher than the upper limits may be counterproductive!

**Default values for Focus Timer**

* `NUM_OF_CYCLE = 2`
* `WORK_TIME = 1`
* `BREAK_TIME = 1`
* `LONG_BREAK_TIME = 1`

Example of usage:

`config`

Expected outcome:

```
************************************************************
    Okay, here's your configured session details!
    Cycles: 2
    Work: 1 minute
    Break: 1 minute
    Long break: 1 minute
************************************************************
```

Example of usage 2:

`config --longbreak 10 --cycle 4 --work 30 --break 5`

Expected outcome:

```
************************************************************
    Okay, here's your configured session details!
    Cycles: 4
    Work: 30 minutes
    Break: 5 minutes
    Long break: 10 minutes
************************************************************
```

## `home` - Return back main WellNUS++

To leave the current feature and return back to main interface. Each individual feature (i.e. atomic habit,
self reflection, focus timer and gamification) has this command with customised
output messages.

Format: `home`

Example of usage 1:

`home`

Expected outcome for atomic habit:

```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Thank you for using atomic habits. Do not forget about me!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Example of usage 2:

`home`

Expected outcome for self reflection:

```
============================================================
    How do you feel after reflecting on yourself?
    Hope you have gotten some takeaways from self reflection, see you again!!
============================================================
```

**Note**: These are just particular examples taken from specific features, and are **_not representative_** of
other features' `home` commands. Please try the `home` command inside our application to view the actual customised
output for other features.

## `exit` - Exit WellNUS++

Exits `WellNUS++`. Data of the current progress will be saved in data files and restored at the next launch
of `WellNUS++`.

Format: `exit`

Take note that users are only allowed to exit from **main** WellNUS++ (i.e. users cannot exit the program from
individual features like atomic habit, and the `exit` command is not recognised inside feature sessions).

Example of usage:

`exit`

Expected outcome:

```
------------------------------------------------------------
    Thank you for using WellNUS++! See you again soon Dx
------------------------------------------------------------
