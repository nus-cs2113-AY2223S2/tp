## Introduction

Our Expense Tracker CLI software ("ET" for short) allows users to create their own bookmakers and helps
them keep track of their expense based on category, time, amount, and currency.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `ET` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T13-2/tp/releases).
3. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tp.jar` command to run
   the application.
4. Enter your name when prompted in the command box and press enter.
5. Log in to your account by typing `login` if you have already got one. Else, typing `signup` to create your account,
   and then press Enter to proceed. After signing up successfully, you should log in to experience the app. More instructions
   about the account and password are stated in the "Account Instructions" part.
6. Once you have logged in successfully, you will see a message `Login successful`, and you are ready to experience our
   application! You will see a command box for command instructions.
7. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.

   Some example commands you can try:

    * `add amt/100 t/15-03-2023`: Add an expense entry with a value of SGD100.0 and a date of 15th March 2023 to the
      expense list.
    * `list`: List all expenses in the expense list.
    * `delete 1`: Delete the first entry in the expense list.
    * `sort D`: Sort the expenses by date.
    * `category food`: Find all expenses with food category.
    * `find 2.5`: Find all expenses with information of 2.5.
   
8. When you want to log out and save your expense list, type `logout`.
9. If you have already logged in, and want to close the application, type `exit`. Your expense list will be saved
   automatically.
10. Else, if you haven't logged in, or have already logged out, and you want to close the application, typing `exit`
    will end the application immediately.

## Account instructions
### Create Account: `signup`

* When you sign up, you should type your username, press Enter, then type your password, and press Enter.
* If your username is taken already, you should sign up again. Else, you could proceed to `login`.

Format: <br>
```
signup
username
your_username     //Type your username after seeing `username`, then press 'Enter'
password
your_password   //Type your password after seeing `Password`, then press 'Enter'
```

Expected Output: <br>
* This will be displayed when your username contains a special characters (ie `_` in `your_username`):
```
Username must contain only letters and numbers.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
> Type "login" to start manage your expense. 
> Haven't got your account yet? Type "signup" to create your account. 
> Type "exit" to instantly terminate the program.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
```

* This will be displayed when your password is less than 8 characters:

```
Password must be at least 8 characters long.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
> Type "login" to start manage your expense. 
> Haven't got your account yet? Type "signup" to create your account. 
> Type "exit" to instantly terminate the program.
_____________________________________________________________________________________

```

_____________________________________________________________________________________
> Type "login" to start manage your expense. 
> Haven't got your account yet? Type "signup" to create your account. 
> Type "exit" to instantly terminate the program.
_____________________________________________________________________________________

```
* For all those cases, the user will need to change to `login` or `exit`, or continue to signup until they could create 
a satisfied account. When the username is satisfied, this will be displayed:
```
User <your_username> has been created
Signup successfully
_____________________________________________________________________________________
> Type "login" to start manage your expense. 
> Haven't got your account yet? Type "signup" to create your account. 
> Type "exit" to instantly terminate the program.
_____________________________________________________________________________________
```
Then, you can log in to your new account.
### Note: Username and password rules:

* Username must just include alphabet characters (both uppercase and lowercase) or numbers.
* Password must have at least 8 characters.
* Username is not case-sensitive, (ie ABC and abc are considered 1 user), but password is case-sensitive.

### Log In To Your Account: `login`

* In order to log in to your account, you do similar steps as `signup`.
* If you type the password wrongly, you will see the message `Invalid username or password.` and you have to log in again.

password
your_password   //Type your password after seeing `Password`, then press 'Enter'
```

```
After that, you can start managed your expense in your account
* Else, this will be displayed, meaning that you will have to type the password again:
```

## FAQ

### Do I require an internet connection to use ET?

- No an internet connection is not required. It is preferred as we use an exchange rate API to obtain our currency
exchange rates. However, a lack of internet connection will not hinder the use of our application.

### Why is my primary currency not available for use?

- Our selection of currencies is based on the currencies available in our exchange rate API, we apologise if
your currency is not available for use.

### I want to add a date beyond 1981, how do I do that?

- Our API only contains exchange rate information starting from 1981. For ET to effectively track expenses in different
currencies, we require a limit on how far back the date can be set.
