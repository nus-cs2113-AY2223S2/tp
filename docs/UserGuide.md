### Adding a transaction

An integral feature of any budgeting application is to add transactions. The "add" function of rainyDay allows you
to keep track of your inflows and outflows. The following explains how you can add different types of transactions
to rainyDay.

#### Simple Usage

Format: `add [-DIRECTION] [DESCRIPTION] [$AMOUNT]`

* `DIRECTION` should be either:
    * `in` signifying an inflow type of transaction, or
    * `out` signifying an outflow type of transaction
* `DESCRIPTION` signifies the description of the transaction, consisting of words
* `AMOUNT` signifies the cost of transaction, needs to be a number more than or equal to 0

Example of usage:

You received a gift of $500 from your mother. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided to rainyDay:

* `add -in gift from mom $500` - Signifies an inflow with the description "gift from mom" of value "$500"

You paid for your school fees of $1000.50. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided to rainyDay:

* `add -out school fees $1000.50` - Signifies an outflow with the description "school fees" of value "$1000.50"

#### Advanced Usage

Format: `add [-DIRECTION] [DESCRIPTION] [$AMOUNT] {-c CATEGORY} {-date DD/MM/YYYY}`

* `DIRECTION`, `DESCRIPTION`, `AMOUNT` is as mentioned under [Simple Usage](#simple-usage)
* `CATEGORY` can contain any characters and space
* `DD/MM/YYYY` represents a valid date, where
    * `DD` is a two-digit number representing the day
    * `MM` is a two-digit number representing the month
    * `YYYY` is a four-digit number representing the year

Example of usage:

You received your monthly income of $2000 on 05/03/2023. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided to
rainyDay:

* `add -in income $2000 -c pay -date 05/03/2023` - Signifies an inflow with the description "income" of value "$2000",
  under the category of "pay" with the date "05/03/2023"

You had lunch at a hawker centre for $6.80 on 10/03/2023. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided
to rainyDay:

* `add -out lunch at hawker centre $6.80 -c food and drinks -date 10/03/2023` - Signifies an outflow with the
  description
  "lunch at hawker center" of value "$6.80", under the category of "food and drinks" and with the date "10/03/2023".

> 💡**Tip:** The flags `-c` and `-date` can also be used exclusively. The following are also valid formats:
>
> * `add -DIRECTION DESCRIPTION $AMOUNT -c CATEGORY`
> * `add -DIRECTION DESCRIPTION $AMOUNT -date DD/MM/YYYY`

### Viewing the transactions

An important aspect to track your finances is to view all the transactions that you have already done before. The "view"
command of rainyDay can list all the transaction added, and the resultant amount of all your inflows and outflows.

Format: `view {TIMESPAN} {-sort}`

* `TIMESPAN` is used to denote how much history to show.
    * `1d - 31d` is used to view 1 to 31 days of history
    * `1w - 4w`  is used to view 1 to 4 weeks of history
    * `1m - 12m` is used to view 1 to 12 months of history
    * `1y - 10y` is used to view 1 to 10 years of history
* `-sort` can be included to sort entries in ascending order, with inflows displayed before outflows.

> 💡**Tip:** To view all entries you can use -all in place of a specific time in TIMESPAN

```

+====================================================================================================+
```

### Deleting a transaction

The transactions added into rainyDay are not fixed. For whatever reason that you require deleting any transaction data,
rainyDay's "delete" function supports removing any previous transaction from your overview.

Format: `delete [INDEX]`

* `INDEX` is the transaction number given by rainyDay to a transaction
    * The transaction number can be obtained from [viewing the transactions](#viewing-the-transactions)

Example of usage:
Your current financial report is at the state in the example given in the 
[viewing the transactions](#viewing-the-transactions) section.
To delete the transaction with the description "beef noodles", you can use the command:

`delete 3`

The transaction with the description "beef noodles" will be deleted, and the transactions shown to you
subsequently after requesting to view the transactions will be as such: <br>
```
> delete 3
Done, deleted "beef noodles" from the financial report
> view

### Editing a transaction

Should you need to update details in a previous transaction, rainyDay's "edit" function supports changing the details of
a past transaction

Format : `edit [INDEX] [FLAG] {NEWFIELD}`

* The `FLAG` must be one of the following:
    * `-d` to edit the description
    * `-c` to edit the category
    * `-v` to edit the value
    * `-date` to edit the date
    * `-in` to change direction to inflow
    * `-out` to change direction to outflow

* No `NEWFIELD` required for changing direction

Example of usage:

After requesting to view the transactions from rainyDay, the following is shown to you:

### Setting a Monthly Budget

In the process of keeping track of your expenses, you might feel inclined to stick to a budget. RainyDay can help
to give you reminders, and encourage you to stick to your budget!
With a set monthly budget, RainyDay will remind you how much you have spent for the month with
every new expense in the same month.

Format : `setbudget GOAL`

For example, if you would like to set a monthly budget goal of $1000, use the command below:<br>
`setbudget 1000`
```
> setbudget 1000
Monthly Budget Goal set to $1,000.00!
```
An additional message will accompany new expenses on how much you have spent for the month!

```
> add -out noodles $5
Done! Added: out for noodles, -$5.00
You have spent $544.00/$1000.00, Keep it up!
```

If at any point of time you would like to remove this feature, simply set the goal to $0<br>
`setbudget 0`

```
> setbudget 0
Monthly Budget Goal removed!
```
### Adding a shortcut

If you happen to have certain commands that you find yourself frequently using, rainyDay's shortcuts can make it much
easier to execute those commands!

Format: `shortcut [SHORTCUTNAME] -maps [ACTUALCOMMAND]`

* `SHORTCUTNAME` can be any single word of your choice to save a reference to the actual command
* `ACTUALCOMMAND` is the actual command which you want your shortcut to perform

Example of usage:

You often eat the same noodle dish from your favourite coffee shop. To save yourself the trouble of typing the same
command in full, you could configure the shortcut with the command below.

`shortcut FavLunch -maps add -out noodles $4 -c food`

```
> shortcut FavLunch -maps add -out noodles $4 -c food
Shortcut successfully added
```

> ⚠️ Avoid adding a shortcut with the same name as an actual command. The actual command will take priority over your
> configured shortcut.

### Using a shortcut

After configuring your shortcuts, you may want to use the shortcut to save yourself the trouble of typing the
full command. This can be done by simply inputting the name of your configured shortcut command.

Format: `[SHORTCUTNAME]`

Example of Usage:

You have configured the shortcut according to the example in the [adding a shortcut](#adding-a-shortcut) section. Now
all you have to do is input the name of your configured shortcut command.

`FavLunch`
```
> FavLunch
Done! Added: out for noodles, -$4.00
```

### Viewing a shortcut

After configuring all your shortcuts, the `shortcut_view` command can be used to keep track of all your shortcuts
that you have configured.

Example of Usage:

`shortcut_view`

The output will look something like this:

```
shortcut_view
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|Here are your shortcuts!                                                                         |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|Shortcut                           |Mapped Command                                               |
|a                                  |add -in daily salary $5                                      |
|v                                  |view                                                         |
|FavLunch                           |add -out noodles $4 -c food                                  |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Deleting a shortcut

At some point, you may discover that the shortcut you configured is no longer useful, or you may have misconfigured a
previously added shortcut. In these situations, the `shortcut_delete` command provided by rainyDay can prove to be quite
handy.

Format: `shortcut_delete [SHORTCUTCOMMAND]`

* `SHORTCUTCOMMAND` The shortcut command that you want deleted

Example of Usage:

You have configured the shortcut according to the example in the [adding a shortcut section](#adding-a-shortcut).
Unfortunately, your favourite coffee shop has closed down, and you are no longer able to enjoy your favourite noodle
dish. Now the shortcut you previously configured is no longer useful. All you have to do is delete the shortcut with the
command below: 

`shortcut_delete FavLunch`

### Ignoring an entry

Due to potential certain one-time payments or receivables that you encounter, rainyDay's ignore function can help you
keep a more accurate track of your finances by allowing you to ignore certain transactions from the overall calculation
of your inflow and outflow.
Conversely, the unignore function is to include a transaction that was previously ignored.

Format: `ignore [index]` or `unignore [index]`

* `index` The index of the entry you want to ignore, obtained by using the `view` command

Example of Usage:

You have received a one-time payment from government GST refunds. You would like to keep track of it however do not want
to include it in your budget calculations. After executing the add command, input view to find its index.
