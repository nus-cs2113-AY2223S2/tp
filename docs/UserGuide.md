### Adding an event: `add`
Adds an event to the schedule. Assuming x is an switch. Use ‚Äìx to specify the attributes to edit.

Format: `add ‚Äìe EVENTNAME ‚Äìst STARTTIME ‚Äìsd STARTDATE ‚Äìet ENDTIME ‚Äìed ENDDATE -v VENUE -r RECURRING TIME`
* `sd` and `ed` must be of the format `YYYY/MM/DD`
* `e`, `sd` and `st` are **compulsory** fields
* `ed` and `et` are **optional**: 
  * if user input **ed without et**, ed value will be ignored
  * if user input **et without ed**, ed value will be set to the same as sd by default. 

* `v` is **optional**
* `r` is optional, the format is `x D/ x W`, which means the event will happen in every x day(s)/x week(s).

#### Examples of usage
1. Add event that starts and ends on different days: `add -e Career Fair -st 14:00 -sd 2023/02/10 -et 16:00 -ed 2023/02/11`
2. Add event that happens every week: `add -e collect mails -st 08:00 -sd 2023/02/10 -et 08:10 -ed 2023/02/10 -r 1 W`

**Notice:** 

> - Date/time formats like 8:00 or 2023/4/1 are not accepted. The format should be strictly	`two digits`:`two digits`	(08:00 and 2023/04/01 in this case).
>
> - App will omit possible negative recurring time that users might input and consider the current event non-recurring.
> 
> - Users are able to add events that are not within the semester boundaries, however it will not be shown in the timetable user interface and will only be listed out.
>

Expected outcome:

1. ~~~
	____________________________________________________________
	Event successfully added:
	
    	> [E] Career Fair (2023/02/10 14:00 to 2023/02/11 16:00 not recurring)

   ____________________________________________________________
   ~~~
   



**Confliction Checking:** 

- NUSPlanner will only check for conflicts between events and classes that have **starting date & time and ending date & time, within the time period of selected semester.**
- Users need to check themselves whether the events will clash with each other during vacation periods.

Format: `add ‚Äìm MODULECODE -n CLASSNUMBER -l LESSONTYPE`
* All fields are **<u>compulsory</u>**

#### Examples of usage
* Add a lecture of module: `add -m AC5001 -n 1 -l LEC`
* Add a tutorial of module: `add -m CS2100 -n 11 -l TUT`

#### How to find the correct `MODULECODE`, `CLASSNUMBER` and `LESSONTYPE`?
* Head over to [NUSMods](https://nusmods.com/timetable/sem-2)
* Find the class and slot that you want
* For example, user wants to take these 3 slots:

<p align = "center">
<img src="NUSModsEG.png" style="zoom:30%;" >
</p>

> `MODULECODE`: Module code
> 
>`CLASSNUMBER`: Number that is allocated to class. It is in this format: [X]
> 
>`LESSONTYPE`: Refer to table below.
* Commands used for this case are
`add -m CS2100 -n 01 -l TUT`, `add -m CS2100 -n 02 -l LAB` and `add -m CS2100 -n 1 -l LEC`
* Please type out your commands and ensure your spelling is accurate
* Copying and pasting commands from the user guide may cause some issues due to formatting

### Editing an event: `edit`
Edit an event that has been added to the schedule. Use ‚Äìx to specify the attributes to edit.

Format: `edit -i INDEX_OF_EVENT ‚Äìst STARTTIME ‚Äìsd STARTDATE ‚Äìet ENDTIME ‚Äìed ENDDATE -v VENUE -r x D/W`

**notice:**

> when Editing the event, User need to rewrite the complete time information including the parts that they do not what to change
>
> the format is the same as it in add command
> 
> Modification of specific module slots (tutorial, lecture, etc) are allowed in the event of public holidays/NUS Well Being day. This ensures that users have full control over their tiemtable and can make easy edits if their professor or teaching assistance decides to change the day/time slot.
> 
> Modifications can also be made to move slots (tutorial, lecture, etc) to after semester boundaries. This is normal behaviour as we give users full control over their timetable

* `sd` and `ed` must be of the format `YYYY/MM/DD`
* `e`, `sd` and `st` are **compulsory** fields
* `ed` and `et` are **optional**,
  * if user input **`ed` without `et`**, ed value will be ignored
  * if user input **`et` without `ed`**, ed value will be set to the same as sd by default. 

* other fields are **optional**.

#### Examples of usage
1. Edit the start time of an event: `edit ‚Äìi 1 -sd 2023/04/01 ‚Äìst 16:00` 

2. Edit the start date, start time and end time of an event: `edit -i 1 ‚Äìsd 2023/02/11 ‚Äìst 08:00 ‚Äìet 10:00 `

**notice:** 

> Similar to add command, the app will also check whether there is any confliction between the new revised time and other events/classes with **full details of time information** if and only if the revised time information also have **starting date & time and ending date & time**
>
> The app will also only check confliction within the current semester. 
>
> **User cannot change recurring time and venue using edit command once they have added it.**

Expected outcome:
1. ~~~
	____________________________________________________________
	Time of event: event is changed to:
    	> 2023/04/01 16:00 not recurring
	____________________________________________________________
	~~~

2. ~~~
	____________________________________________________________
	Time of event: event is changed to: ed 2023/02/11
       > 2023/02/11 08:00 to 2023/02/11 10:00 not recurring
	____________________________________________________________

### Saving Data
NusPlanner data are saved to the hard drive automatically after the `bye` command to quit it. There is no need to save manually.
Please note that data will only be saved if application closes as per normal (not crashed or closed with Cntrl + C).
### Editing the data file
Data for NUSPlanner is saved as a `.json` file. The path for the save file is `[JAR file location]/save.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing the data file.

üöß **Warning**: If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, NUSPlanner will discard all data and load an empty data file at the next run.
 
### NUSMods Data
NusPlanner runs an offline version of the NUSMods API. The NUSMods data stored in NUSPlanner is correct as of **March 17, 2023**.

## FAQ

**Q**: Why is a JAR file required?

**A**: Java ARchive, also known as JAR, is a container that groups multiple small files to enable efficient execution, which is similar to a ZIP file.

**Q**: How can I force quit the application?

**A**: We have intentionally left in Cntrl + C command in this event of emergencies like this. 

**Q**: Why doesn't the application save the semester I am in?

**A**: We have intentionally made NUSPlanner to work this way so that users will not be restricted in planning the semester they are currently in only. For example, students may want to plan for their future timetable in semester 2, while currently in semester 1.

**Q**: Why doesn't the application stop me from adding events to dates that has already passed?

**A**: NUSPlanner provides users with the flexibility and full control over the timetable and does not stop users from adding events on dates that have passed.

**Q**: Where can I report bugs I found while using NUSPlanner?

**A**: Our team of developers are always on the look-out to fix such bugs.
Please add a description of the bug found under our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-3/tp/issues).
