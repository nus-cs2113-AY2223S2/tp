## Introduction

### Motivation of creating rainyDay

In addition to rising costs of living, young adults like yourself just entering the workforce will be exposed to new
sources of expenses and income. Thus, rainyDay was created to aid you in keeping track and managing your finances well.
rainyDay accomplishes this by providing an easy-to-use and convenient platform to track
your [inflows and outflows](#glossary),
to help you achieve your financial goals.

While there is a large variety of other financial trackers, only a handful of them have integrated a
[Command Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary) into their systems. However, the utilisation of a CLI can significantly
improve the speed and accuracy of user-provided information. If you have not used a CLI before, do not fret as we
will guide you through the [process](#understanding-cli).

With this user guide, you will be guided through every step of the way from installation to the usage of advanced
features
so that you can be an expert at rainyDay.

### What rainyDay can do for you

rainyDay supports a variety of features for you to view your [transactions](#glossary). A basic overview is provided as
follows:

**Transaction related** - Add, delete, and edit transaction entries <br>
**Viewing related** - View, filter, and sort transactions based on criteria  <br>
**Budget related** - Set a budget to adhere to

For more in-depth information, please refer to the [Features Overview](#features-overview) section.

## Features

### Viewing help

Welcome to the help section of rainyDay! Now that you have started rainyDay by following the [Quick Start](#quick-start)
section, you will need to know the format of inputs to send to rainyDay. Whenever you find yourself stuck trying to
perform a certain task, don't worry! The help command is here to help you every step of the way!

To get an overview of possible commands and their respective formats, you can use the `help` command as seen
below:

Format: **`help`**

The table below will be shown with the `help` command: <br>

![help.png](images/UserGuide/help.png)

Suppose you require more details on any of the other commands, you can use the following command:

Format: **`help {COMMAND}`**

This command will give you more information on the particular command, such as input constraints and examples.

Example of Usage:

Suppose you want to find out more information on rainyDay's `add` command, you can use the following command:

![helpAdd.png](images/UserGuide/helpAdd.png)

### Transactions

Next is the transaction management section of our guide! In this section, we'll cover all the key details to manage your
transactions effectively. Whether you need to add, view, delete, or edit transactions, rainyDay has got you covered.
We'll also show you how to filter and ignore any transactions that are irrelevant to your
needs. So, if you're ready to take control of your finances and maintain accurate data, let's begin!

* [Adding a transaction](#adding-a-transaction)
* [Viewing the transactions](#viewing-the-transactions)
* [Deleting a transaction](#deleting-a-transaction)
* [Editing a transaction](#editing-a-transaction)
* [Filter transactions](#filter-transactions)
* [Ignoring a transaction](#ignoring-a-transaction)

### Adding a transaction

An integral feature of any financial tracker is to add transactions. The "add" feature of rainyDay allows you
to keep track of your inflows and outflows. The following explains how you can add different types of transactions
to rainyDay.

Format: **`add [DIRECTION] [DESCRIPTION] [AMOUNT] {CATEGORY} {DATE}`**

* `DIRECTION` should be either:
    * `-in` signifying an [inflow](#glossary) type of transaction, or
    * `-out` signifying an [outflow](#glossary) type of transaction
* `DESCRIPTION` signifies the description of the transaction, consisting of [alphanumeric](#glossary) characters and
  space
* `AMOUNT` signifies the value of the transaction, where the number needs to be more than 0, with `$` appended
  before the number
* `CATEGORY` is a field representing the category to be tagged with the transaction, where category can consist of
  [alphanumeric](#glossary) characters and space, with `-c` appended before the category
* `DATE` is a field representing the date to be tagged with the transaction, where date needs to be in the format
  of `DAY/MONTH/YEAR`, with `-date` appended before the date
    * `DAY` and `MONTH` can either be a single or double-digit number
    * `YEAR` needs to be a four-digit number
    * When this field is omitted, the date will be set to the day when the transaction is added to rainyDay

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please avoid doing the following:
> - Amount provided must be a positive value and cannot be more than $21,474,836.47!
> - `DESCRIPTION` and `CATEGORY` cannot contain dash `-`
> - `CATEGORY` cannot contain dollar symbol `$`
> - Avoid using characters other than alphanumeric characters and space as it could lead to abnormal behaviour

> üí° The flags `-c` and `-date` can be used exclusively. The following are also valid formats:
>
> * `add -DIRECTION DESCRIPTION $AMOUNT -c CATEGORY`
> * `add -DIRECTION DESCRIPTION $AMOUNT -date DD/MM/YYYY`

Example of Usage:

You had dinner at Haidilao for $500. To add it to rainyDay, you can use the following command:

![add1Haidilao](images\UserGuide\add1Haidilao.png)

You received an allowance of $20 on 01/04/2023. To add it to rainyDay, you can use the following command:

![add2allowance](images\UserGuide\add2Allowance.png)

You had a bowl of beef noodles for $12. To add it to rainyDay, you can use the following command:

![add3beefnoodles](images\UserGuide\add3beefnoodles.png)

You received your pay of $50000 on 26/04/2023. To add it to rainyDay, you can use the following command:

![add4pay](images\UserGuide\add4Pay.png)

[Jump back to Features Overview](#features-overview)

### Viewing the transactions

After adding your transactions into rainyDay, you can view them by using the "view" feature of rainyDay.
This lists all the transactions added in dated order, and the summary of all your inflows and outflows.

Format: **`view {TIMESPAN} {-sort}`**

* `TIMESPAN` is used to denote how much history to show from the current day.
    * `1d - 31d` is used to view 1 to 31 days of history
    * `1w - 4w`  is used to view 1 to 4 weeks of history
    * `1m - 12m` is used to view 1 to 12 months of history
    * `1y - 10y` is used to view 1 to 10 years of history
* `-sort` can be included to sort entries in ascending order of their absolute value,
  with inflows displayed before outflows.

> üí° To view all entries you can use -all in place of a specific time in TIMESPAN

Example of Usage:

You would like to view all of your transactions for the current month, to check if you are staying within your budget.
To do that, you can use the following command:

![view.png](images/UserGuide/view.png)

You want to know what you spent the most on in the past 2 months. To do that, you can use the following command:

![viewTwoMSort.png](images/UserGuide/viewTwoMSort.png)

[Jump back to Features Overview](#features-overview)

### Deleting a transaction

The transactions added into rainyDay are not fixed. For whatever reason that you require deleting any transactions,
rainyDay's "delete" feature supports removing any previous transactions from your [Financial Report](#glossary).

Format: **`delete [INDEX]`**

* `INDEX` is the transaction number given by rainyDay to identify a transaction
    * The transaction number can be obtained by [viewing the transactions](#viewing-the-transactions)

Example of Usage:

Your current financial report is in the same state as the previous example given in
[viewing the transactions](#viewing-the-transactions).
To delete the transaction with the description "beef noodles", you can use the following command:

![delete.png](images\UserGuide\delete.png)

The transaction with the description "beef noodles" will be deleted, and the transactions shown to you
subsequently after requesting to view them will be as such: <br>

![deleteafter.png](images\UserGuide\deleteafter.png)

[Jump back to Features Overview](#features-overview)

### Editing a transaction

If you need to update details in a previous transaction, rainyDay's "edit" feature will be of much use to you.

Format: **`edit [INDEX] [FLAG] {NEWFIELD}`**

* `INDEX` is the transaction number given by rainyDay to identify a transaction
* `FLAG` must be one of the following:
    * `-in` to change direction to [inflow](#glossary) or `-out` to change direction to [outflow](#glossary)
    * `-d` to edit the description
    * `-c` to edit the category
    * `-v` to edit the value
    * `-date` to edit the date
* `NEWFIELD` is the new information that you would like to change to
    * `NEWFIELD` is not required when changing direction with `-in` or `-out`
    * `NEWFIELD` needs to be in `DAY/MONTH/YEAR` format when changing date with `-date`
    * `NEWFIELD` needs to be appended with a `$` before the number when changing the value with `-v`

Example of Usage:

Suppose you realised you forgot to add the "Category" for entry with index 1, and you would like to place it under
"Food and Drinks". You can use the following command:

![editCategory.png](images/UserGuide/editCategory.png)

and use the `view` command afterwards to verify the edits are accurate:

![editCategoryView.png](images/UserGuide/editCategoryView.png)

Perhaps you realised you made a mistake in the "Amount" for entry with index 2 and your allowance is $75 instead.
You can use the following command:

![editValue.png](images/UserGuide/editValue.png)

and use the `view` command afterwards to verify the edits are accurate:

![editValueView.png](images/UserGuide/editValueView.png)

But what happens if you realised you made multiple mistakes in entry with index 3? Don't worry! You can edit multiple fields at the
same time using multiple flags. However, do take note of the flag order as listed below.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple flags may be used at once, but must be in the following order:
>
> `-in` or `out` -> `-d` -> `-v` -> `-c` -> `-date`

So instead of deleting and adding an entirely new entry or editing the same entry twice,
you can use the following command to update the required fields:

![editMultipleEntries.png](images/UserGuide/editMultipleEntries.png)

and use the `view` command afterwards to verify the edits are accurate:

![editMultipleEntriesView.png](images/UserGuide/editMultipleEntriesView.png)

[Jump back to Features Overview](#features-overview)

### Filter transactions

To save time searching through all the entries in the financial report, the "filter" feature of rainyDay
helps you to extract certain transactions based on specific criteria.

Format: **`filter [FLAG] {FIELD}`**

* `FLAG` must be at least one of the following:
    * `-in` to filter by [inflows](#glossary) or `-out` to filter by [outflows](#glossary)
        * `FIELD` is not required when `-in` or `-out` flag is used
    * `-d` to filter by description
    * `-c` to filter by category
    * `-date` to filter by a specific date or timespan
        * `FIELD` must be in the form `DAY/MONTH/YEAR`
        * If only one `FIELD` is provided, only transactions with the specified date will be shown
        * If two `FIELD` is provided, transactions between the 2 dates (inclusive) will be shown.

Example of Usage:

Let's say you added a couple more entries. And using `view -all` provides you with this:

![filterViewAll.png](images/UserGuide/filterViewAll.png)

> üí° Note the use of `view -all` instead of `view` as `view` only provides entries in the current month.

Suppose you want to find all transactions with the category labelled "Food and Drinks". You can use the following
command:

![filterFood.png](images/UserGuide/filterFood.png)

What happens if you want to filter the transactions based on multiple criteria? Don't worry, we got you covered!
However, do take note of the flag order as listed below:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple flags may be used at once but must be in this order:
>
> `-in` or `out` -> `-d` -> `-c` -> `-date`

Suppose you want to find out what "Food and Drinks" you had from 30th March 2023 to 7th April 2023. You
can use the following command:

![filterMultipleFlags.png](images/UserGuide/filterMultipleFlags.png)

> üí° Note that the first date (e.g. 30/3/2023) provided must be before the second date (e.g. 7/4/2023) when you are
> indicating a date range.

[Jump back to Features Overview](#features-overview)

### Ignoring a transaction

Due to potential one-time payments or receivables that you may encounter, rainyDay's "ignore" feature can help you to
keep a more accurate track of your finances by allowing you to ignore certain transactions from the overall calculations
of your inflow and outflow.
Conversely, the "unignore" feature is used to include a transaction that was previously ignored.

Format: **`ignore [INDEX]`** or **`unignore [INDEX]`**

* `INDEX` is the transaction number given by rainyDay to identify a transaction

Example of Usage:

You have received a one-time payment from government GST refunds. You would like to keep track of it, however you do
not want to include it in your budget calculations. After adding it into rainyDay, using `view` provides you with this:

![ignoreView.png](images/UserGuide/ignoreView.png)

To ignore the index, you can use the following command:

![ignoreGST.png](images/UserGuide/ignoreGST.png)

Now, the value of the transaction will be indicated as ignored, and it will not be used during calculations.
You can see this change by using the `view` command:

![ignoreGSTAfter.png](images/UserGuide/ignoreGSTAfter.png)

[Jump back to Features Overview](#features-overview)

### Setting a Monthly Budget

After knowing how to manage your transactions, the next step to reach your financial goals is to set a monthly budget!
rainyDay can help you by giving you reminders and encouraging you to stick to your budget. With a set monthly budget,
rainyDay will remind you how much you have spent for the month with every new expense.

Format: **`setbudget [AMOUNT]`**

* `AMOUNT` signifies the targeted goal for the user's monthly budget

Example of Usage:

If you would like to set a monthly budget goal of $1000, you can use the following command:

![setBudgetGoal.png](images%2FUserGuide%2FsetBudgetGoal.png)

After setting a goal, an additional message will accompany every new expense on how much you have spent for the month
as shown below:

![addNoodlesBudget.png](images%2FUserGuide%2FaddNoodlesBudget.png)

If at any point of time you would like to remove this feature, simply set the goal to $0.
To do so, you can use the following command:

![unsetBudgetGoal.png](images%2FUserGuide%2FunsetBudgetGoal.png)

[Jump back to Features Overview](#features-overview)

### Shortcuts

After using rainyDay for a period of time, you realised that there are some commands that you seem to repeat frequently.
rainyDay's "shortcut" feature can be utilised to save time! In this section, we'll show you how to create and
use shortcuts effectively. Whether you need to add a new shortcut, view an existing one, or delete an old one, we'll
cover them all. So, if you're ready to start working smarter and not harder, let's dive into the world of shortcuts!

* [Adding a shortcut](#adding-a-shortcut)
* [Using a shortcut](#using-a-shortcut)
* [Viewing a shortcut](#viewing-a-shortcut)
* [Deleting a shortcut](#deleting-a-shortcut)

#### Adding a shortcut

If you would like to add some shortcuts, this is how you can create one!

Format: **`shortcut [SHORTCUTNAME] -maps [ACTUALCOMMAND]`**

* `SHORTCUTNAME` can be any single word of your choice to reference an actual command
* `ACTUALCOMMAND` is the actual command which you want your shortcut to perform

Example of Usage:

You often eat the same noodle dish from your favourite coffee shop. To save yourself the trouble of typing the same
command in full, you can create a shortcut by using the following command:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Your created shortcut should map to a valid full command for it to work correctly.

![shortcutSet.png](images%2FUserGuide%2FshortcutSet.png)

#### Using a shortcut

After creating your shortcuts, you would want to use the shortcut to save yourself the trouble of typing the
full command. This can be done by simply inputting the name of your created shortcut.

Format: **`[SHORTCUTNAME]`**

Example of Usage:

You have created the shortcut according to the example in the [adding a shortcut](#adding-a-shortcut) section. Now,
anytime you want to use your shortcut, all you have to do is input its name as shown below:

![shortcutUsage.png](images%2FUserGuide%2FshortcutUsage.png)

#### Viewing a shortcut

After creating your shortcuts, the `shortcut_view` command can also be used to keep track of all your shortcuts.

Example of Usage:

Suppose you forgot the shortcuts you have created, and you would like to view all of them.
To do so, you can use the following command:

![shortcutView.png](images%2FUserGuide%2FshortcutView.png)

#### Deleting a shortcut

At some point, you may discover that the shortcut you created is no longer useful, or you may have incorrectly created a
previously added shortcut. In these situations, the `shortcut_delete` command can prove to be quite handy.

Format: **`shortcut_delete [SHORTCUTNAME]`**

* `SHORTCUTNAME` The shortcut command that you want deleted

Example of Usage:

You have created the shortcut according to the example in the [adding a shortcut](#adding-a-shortcut) section.
Unfortunately, your favourite coffee shop has closed down, and you are no longer able to enjoy your favourite noodle
dish. Now that the shortcut you previously created is no longer useful, all you have to do is delete the shortcut using
the following command:

![shortcutDelete.png](images%2FUserGuide%2FshortcutDelete.png)

### Data Management

Saving and loading your data is something you don't have to worry about as we got it covered! In this section,
we'll show you where to locate your saved files and how to export your data to a [CSV](#glossary) file, which is a
widely-used file format that can be opened in a variety of software applications. We'll also show you how to export and
view the CSV file using [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel),
which is a popular spreadsheet program used by many people around the world. Let's get started!

[Jump back to Features Overview](#features-overview)

## FAQ

**Q**: I tried to input a value, but it is not showing up as what I typed!

**A**: The value of transactions has a maximum of $21,474,836.47 and will also be rounded down to 2 decimal places.

**Q**: Does rainyDay support the use of [non-alphanumeric characters](#glossary) such as emojis and non-english
characters?

**A**: Using these characters may lead to unexpected behaviours. Hence, users are encouraged to use alphanumeric
characters only when using rainyDay

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: Transfer the entire folder containing the "rainyDay.jar" file from one device to the other device. You can now use 
rainyDay in your new device with the same data you previously saved.

**Q**: I remember having saved data, but why is it that when I start rainyDay, it says that the report is empty?

**A**: When rainyDay detects a [corrupted saved data](#glossary), the data will automatically be deleted. However,
this is extremely unlikely to happen under normal usage. If you intend to edit the data file directly, it is
recommended to keep an extra copy of the data somewhere else to prevent permanent data loss.

**Q**: I used rainyDay and a folder named "logs" appeared. What is the "logs" folder and what are the contents
inside it?

**A**: The "logs" folder contains files that record the processes and status of rainyDay. The files are non-malicious
and their contents do not affect rainyDay's functions. The "logs" folder and its contents can be ignored or deleted.

**Q**: I want to view my transactions for today, but `view 0d` does not work. What should I do?

**A**: You can use the filter feature! To do that, you can type `filter -date [TODAY'S DATE]`
