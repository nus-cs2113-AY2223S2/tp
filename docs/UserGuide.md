## 2. Introduction

---

Are you a current information security undergraduate at NUS? Or are you a prospective student,
about to begin your journey into information security? Well, Modganiser is exactly what you are looking for!

So why Modganiser? We have seen and heard of cases of undergraduates not being able to graduate on time as they have missed out certain requirements. For information security undergraduates who aim to obtain their degree in 4 years, Modganiser provides you a platform to effortlessly plan for the modules you wish to take during your undergraduate journey, all while ensuring that you meet the [graduation requirements](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cugresource/per-cohort/isc/isc-21-22/) on time.

Modganiser works via the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#8-glossary), and while it is a big difference compared to traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications, If you can type fast, Modganiser is much more efficient!

This user guide will now help you navigate through Modganiser and its features. To find out about the various sections in this guide, please refer to the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) on the next page. If you are a new user, do navigate to the

### 5.2 Managing Modules in the Module Plan

#### 5.2.1 Adding Modules: `add`

**Function**

When you have found a module that you would wish to take, you can use this command to add the module to the module plan with the following [parameters](#8-glossary):

| [Parameter](#8-glossary) | Description                                                           | Accepted Inputs                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| MODULE_CODE              | Please refer to [NUSMods](https://nusmods.com) for the Module's Code  | All inputs consisting of [alphanumeric](#8-glossary) characters |
| MODULAR_CREDITS          | The number of modular credits the module is worth                     | 0-41, with no decimal places                                    |
| MODULE_TYPE              | Which category the module falls under                                 | [CORE, GE, UE, INTERNSHIP](#8-glossary)                         |
| YEAR                     | Which year you plan to take the module                                | 1, 2, 3, 4, with no decimal places                              |
| SEMESTER                 | Which semester you plan to take the module                            | 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, with no additional decimal places               |

> üìì [**Note**](#31-special-notations)
>
> 1.5 and 2.5 for SEMESTER refers to Special Term 1 and Special Term 2 respectively.

>‚ùó [**Warning**](#31-special-notations)
>
> - Validity of inputs for MODULE_CODE, MODULAR_CREDITS and MODULE_TYPE is not checked as we cannot maintain a database of modules. 
> - Please double-check the module code and credits on [NUSMods](https://nusmods.com) before entering it into Modganiser. 
> - Furthermore, a module may be taken as a [GE module](#8-glossary) for you but could be taken as a [UE module](#8-glossary) for another user. Please determine the module type by referring to the [graduation requirements](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cugresource/per-cohort/isc/isc-21-22/) before entering it into Modganiser.
> - If you have entered the wrong input for the aforementioned [parameters](#8-glossary), you may edit it using the [edit command](#523-editing-module-details-edit).

<p style = "text-align:right"><small>Click <a href="#table-of-contents">here</a> to return to the Table of Contents</small></p>

**Command Format**

`add /MODULE_CODE /MODULAR_CREDITS /MODULE_TYPE /YEAR /SEMESTER`

Example: `add /CS2113T /4 /CORE /1 /1`. adds the module CS2113T that is worth 4 Modular Credits(MCs) and is a [Core module](#8-glossary) into Year 1 Semester 1.

![AddCommand](UG_Screenshots/AddingAModule.png)

> üìì [**Note**](#31-special-notations)
>
> The C in the first square bracket represents [Core Module](#8-glossary). [GE](#8-glossary), [UE](#8-glossary) and [Internship](#8-glossary) Modules are represented with ‚ÄúGE‚Äù, ‚ÄúUE‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äù respectively as shown in the images below.
>
> ![GEmodule](UG_Screenshots/GE_Module.png)
> ![UEmodule](UG_Screenshots/UE_Module.png)
> ![Internship](UG_Screenshots/Internship_Module.png)

>‚ùó [**Warning**](#31-special-notations)
>
> Missing inputs for the various [parameters](#8-glossary) or having too many inputs for the [parameters](#8-glossary) will cause Modganiser to throw you a warning as shown in the [Notes On The Commands](#32-notes-on-the-commands) section.

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

> üí° [**Tip**](#31-special-notations)
>
> As you will likely take an average of 5 modules in a semester, advanced users can take advantage of being able to add multiple modules with one command.
>
> For example: `add /CS2113T IS4231 CS3235 /4 /CORE /1 /1` will add CS2113T, IS4231 and CS3235 into the module plan. All 3 modules will be reflected as [Core](#8-glossary) modules worth 4 MCs, and will be taken in Year 1 Semester 1.
> ![AddCommand](UG_Screenshots/AddingMultipleModules.png)

>‚ùó [**Warning**](#31-special-notations)
>
> Adding multiple modules should only be used if all the modules have the same inputs for MODULE_TYPE, MODULAR_CREDITS, YEAR and SEMESTER. Example, SIP3200 and CS2113T should not be added together with a single command as SIP3200 is worth 6 modular credits while CS2113T is worth 4 modular credits.

### 5.4 Tracking Graduation Progress

#### 5.4.1 Tracking the Completion of Each Module Type: `track`

**Function**

To know how far you are from fulfilling your graduation requirements, you can use this command to track how many modular credits of a [module type](#8-glossary) you have already added to your module plan.   
Modganiser will then list out all the modules that you have planned under that specific [module type](#8-glossary) and display how many more modular credits is needed before you meet the graduation requirements for that [module type](#8-glossary).  
Additionally, you can also track all the planned modules filtered by their [module type](#8-glossary) at once if you wish to do so.

|  [Parameter](#8-glossary)  |                   Description                    |        Accepted Inputs        |

#### 5.5.4 Saving Module Plan

To ensure that your painstakingly created module plan is not lost, Modganiser automatically saves your module plan into your [local storage](#8-glossary) in your device after every command you input.

To find your save file:
1. Go to your Desktop and find the folder titled ‚ÄúModganiser‚Äù or find the folder where tp.jar is saved.
2. Double-click on the folder and find the folder titled ‚Äúdata‚Äù
3. Double-click on the folder and the file titled ‚Äúmodules.txt‚Äù is the save file

> ‚ùó [**Warning**](#31-special-notations)
>
> Please do not edit this save file to prevent corrupting your saved data.
> If Modganiser detects a corrupted save file, Modganiser will remove the corrupted save file and create a blank save file (ie. Your entire module plan will be deleted).
> Hence, please do not tamper with the save file if you are not certain that your actions will not corrupt the save file.

Your saved module plan will be automatically loaded when you run Modganiser.

> üìì [**Note**](#31-special-notations)
>
> If you switch devices and want to import your module plan from your old device to
the new one, firstly locate your save file on the old device, which is just a normal text
file. You can then use any form of messaging applications like [Telegram](https://telegram.org/), email applications
like [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/) or online cloud storage like [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) to send this save file to yourself or
store this save file. You can then retrieve this save file from your new device. On your new device, set up Modganiser and locate the save file on your new device. Replace this save file with the one from your old device.
