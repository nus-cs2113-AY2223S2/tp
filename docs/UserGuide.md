# User Guide

## Introduction

Dr Duke is a desktop app for diagnosing patients who have **_mild_** illnesses, 
optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). 

Doctor Duke can diagnose illnesses and suggest medicine accordingly faster than visiting a General Practitioner.

Note: Dr Duke is NOT a multi-user application as defined by CS2113 rules, and does not violate any of the conditions
listed of a multi-user application by CS2113 definition.

## Start Guide

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Down the latest version of **Dr Duke** from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-W13-1/tp/releases/tag/v2.0).
3. Download the jar file from the latest release, labelled as **DrDuke.jar**.
4. Place the file in the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Duke.
5. Run the jar file via double-clicking on the JAR file, or by copying the file path and entering the copied
   filepath command into your terminal:

Example:

~~~
java -jar "C:\Users\Albert\Desktop\DrDuke.jar"

### Appendix: Corrupted data
Once corruption is detected in any of the data files upon start 
up, Dr Duke will automatically exit WITHOUT SAVING with the 
following error message:
~~~
ERROR: Data file is corrupted. Clear all data files or 
restore data to uncorrupted state before trying again.
~~~
This is to give the user a chance to restore the data file(s) and
undo any tampering previously carried out, instead of 
mercilessly wiping all data from existence. The option is thus
given to the user to either restore the data or clear it entirely.

Should the corruption be undone, Dr Duke will next start up
successfully as if no corruption had ever existed.
