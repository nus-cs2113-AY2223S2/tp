Name: Dumbbell Incline Row
Difficulty Level: beginner
Workout Type: upper body
Using a neutral grip, lean into an incline bench., Take a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip, beginning with the upper body straight.

Exercise ID: 673. 
Name: Single-Arm Cable Crossover
Difficulty Level: beginner
Workout Type: upper body
Begin by moving the pulleys to the high position, select the resistance to be used, and take a handle in each hand., Step forward in front of both pulleys with your upper body extended in front of you, bringing your hands together. Your head and upper body should be up as you lean forward, while your feet should be staggered. This will be your starting position., Keeping your left arm in place, allow your right arm to extend out to the side, maintaining a slight bend at the elbow. The right arm should be perpendicular to the body at approximately shoulder level., Return your arm back to the starting position by pulling your hand back to the midline of the body., Hold for a second at the starting position and repeat the movement on the opposite side. Continue alternating back and forth for the prescribed number of repetitions.

Exercise ID: 546. 
Name: Power Clean
Difficulty Level: intermediate
Workout Type: legs
Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart and toes pointing out slightly., Squat down and grasp bar with a closed, pronated grip. Your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart outside knees with elbows fully extended., Place the bar about 1 inch in front of your shins and over the balls of your feet., Your back should be flat or slightly arched, your upper body held up and out and your shoulder blades should be retracted., Keep your head in a neutral position (in line with vertebral column and not tilted or rotated) with your eyes focused straight ahead. Inhale during this phase., Lift the bar from the floor by forcefully extending the hips and the knees as you exhale. Tip: The upper torso should maintain the same angle. Do not bend at the waist yet and do not let the hips rise before the upper body (this would have the effect of pushing the legs in the air and stretching the legs., Keep elbows fully extended with the head in a neutral position and the upper body over the bar., As the bar raises keep it as close to the shins as possible., As the bar passes the knees, thrust your hips forward and slightly bend the knees to avoid locking them. Tip: At this point your thighs should be against the bar., Keep the back flat or slightly arched, elbows fully extended and your head neutral. Tip: You will hold your breath until the next phase., Inhale and then forcefully and quickly extend your hips and knees and stand on your toes., Keep the bar as close to your body as possible. Tip: Your back should be flat with the elbows pointed out to the sides and your head in a neutral position. Also, keep your upper body over the bar and upper body straight as long as possible., When your lower body joints are fully extended, shrug the upper body upward rapidly without letting the elbows flex yet. Exhale during this portion of the movement., As the upper body reach their highest elevation flex your elbows to begin pulling your body under the bar., Continue to pull the upper body as high and as long as possible. Tip: Due to the explosive nature of this phase, your torso will be erect or with an arched back, your head will be tilted back slightly and your feet may lose contact with the floor., After the lower body has fully extended and the bar reaches near maximal height, pull your body under the bar and rotate the upper body around and under the bar., Simultaneously, flex the hips and knees into a quarter squat position., Once the upper body are under the bar, inhale and then lift your elbows to position the upper upper body parallel to the floor. Rack the bar across the front of your collar bones and front shoulder muscles., Catch the bar with an erect and tight torso, a neutral head position and flat feet. Exhale during this movement., Stand up by extending the hips and knees to a fully erect position., Lower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular tension of the upper body to allow a controlled descent of the bar to the thighs. Inhale during this movement., Simultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the thighs., Squat down with the elbows fully extended until the bar touches the floor., Start over at Phase 1 and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

These exercises can be enhanced and filtered using our filter parameters (Please see below)
## View filters used in generating workouts: ```filters```

Shows a list of filters available and their description.

The filters are shown here:


| Filter   | Description                                   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| [gym]    | exercises that can be done with gym equipment |
| [static] | exercises that only require your body         |
| [easy]   | exercises of low intensity                    |
| [medium] | exercises of medium intensity                 |
| [hard]   | exercises of hard intensity                   |
| [upper]  | exercises that train your upper body          |
| [core]   | exercises that train your core                |
| [legs]   | exercises that train your legs                |



## Generating a list of workouts according to filters: ```generate [arguments] [number]```

*Easter Egg: Having the [number] as 1337 would always generate the first 3 workouts no matter the filters*

Shows a list containing *number* of _random_ workouts that suits the arguments filter.


*Possible arguments are*:

*Body Part*: ```upper```, ```core```, ```legs```

*Difficulty*: ```easy```, ```medium```, ```hard```,

*Type*: ```static```, ```gym```

generate static upper easy 2
Exercise ID: 842. 
Name: V-Bar Pullup
Difficulty Level: beginner
Workout Type: upper body
Start by placing the middle of the V-bar in the middle of the pull-up bar (assuming that the pull-up station you are using does not have neutral grip handles). The V-Bar handles will be facing down so that you can hang from the pull-up bar through the use of the handles., Once you securely place the V-bar, take a hold of the bar from each side and hang from it. Stick your upper body out and lean yourself back slightly in order to better engage the upper body. This will be your starting position., Using your upper body, pull your torso up while leaning your head back slightly so that you do not hit yourself with the chin-up bar. Continue until your upper body nearly touches the V-bar. Exhale as you execute this motion., After a second hold on the contracted position, slowly lower your body back to the starting position as you breathe in., Repeat for the prescribed number of repetitions.

Exercise ID: 95. 
Name: Body Tricep Press
Difficulty Level: beginner
Workout Type: upper body
Position a bar in a rack at upper body height., Standing, take a shoulder width grip on the bar and step a yard or two back, feet together and upper body extended so that you are leaning on the bar. This will be your starting position., Begin by flexing the elbow, lowering yourself towards the bar., Pause, and then reverse the motion by extending the elbows., Progress from bodyweight by adding chains over your upper body.

## Getting into a workout: ```start```
Enters a workout session with the **previously (latest) generated** workout session.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
   <img class="emoji" title=":exclamation:" alt=":exclamation:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2757.png" height="20" width="20"> <strong>Caution:</strong>
   <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight:Arial; font-weight:bold ;color:#993000"> **Note that you must have at least one previously generated workout to start.
   </p>
   <p style="font-size: 18px; font-family:Arial; font-weight:bold; color:#993000"> **Note that you will not be able to access some features until you complete your exercise </p>
</div>



Example Command: ```start```
For example, let the previously generated workout be the following workout:

```
Exercise ID: 402. 
Name: Lateral Bound
Workout Type: legs
Assume a half squat position facing 90 degrees from your direction of travel. This will be your starting position., 
Allow your lead leg to do a countermovement inward as you shift your weight to the outside leg.
Immediately push off and extend, attempting to bound to the side as far as possible., Upon landing, immediately push off in the opposite direction, returning to your original start position., Continue back and forth for several repetitions.

Exercise ID: 291. 
Name: Front Leg Raises
Stand next to a chair or other support, holding on with one hand., Swing your leg forward, keeping the leg straight. Continue with a downward swing, bringing the leg as far back as your flexibility allows. Repeat 5-10 times, and then switch legs.
```

If the user calls the start command, this should be the corresponding output:
```
The current workout contains: 
1) Lateral Bound
2) Front Leg Raises
Start workout! You got this, all the best!
```

## Achievements: ```achievements``` ```clear_achievements```
A list of achievements exist to provide motivation upon the completion of a workout.
Each achievement consists of:<br>
1) A name <br>
2) A set number of exercises required to complete the achievement<br>
3) The achievement's difficulty level<br>
4) The current number of exercises under the achievement's category completed.
   <br><br>
   Calling the ```achievements``` command will list out all the details of all the available achievements.
   The format of each achievement is as follows:
```
23)  The Static Warrior: Complete 3 Static workouts!
Difficulty: **
Not Achieved :(
Current Count: 0
```

For testing purposes, there is also a ```clear_achievements``` command that allows a tester to 
clear all the data for a user. This means that all the exercises logged by the achievements is erased, and all completed
achievements are removed. 
<br><br>

**This is meant for testing purposes, as it allows a tester to easily reset and test whether an achievement
works or not for different inputs.**

Expected Output on command call:
```
Cleared achievement data

   <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight:Arial; font-weight:bold ;color:#993000">The storage methods for 
      data and achievements are different.
      <br>

      Justification: The data command is meant to store a user's completed exercise history, hence it should be updated. <br>
      <br> However, achievements are meant to motivate users to continue using FitnessDuke. Deleting one's counts from their 
      achievements and hence removing one's achievements would serve to demotivate users, being counter-intuitive

# Resource data

FitnessDuke's exercise data are saved as a JSON file within the jar package. Please do not unpack the jar file and 
modify its contents and attempt to re-jar it. We will not guarantee the promised features if the jar file is 
tampered with.

The achievement data is also stored as a text file not to be tampered with. On the off chance that the file is 
tampered with, the data will not be loaded in, and the achievement will not be loaded in on a line-by-line basis (i.e.
if a specific line of data is corrupt, that specific achievement is not loaded, but the rest will work.)

# FAQ
**Q**: Can I add my own workouts to the program?

**A**: This is a very intuitive feature, but we have not implemented it yet.
