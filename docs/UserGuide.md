## Introduction üßÆ

Hello! Welcome to BadMaths! BadMaths is an integrated study tool that performs Mathematical Operations and contains
various features for note-taking.

To help you get started, our team has put together this user guide to guide you on
the steps to operate BadMaths for your study woes.

## Quick Start

Before you start using BadMaths, make sure you have the following ready!

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Down the latest version of `BadMaths` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F10-2/tp/releases).

## Features

### 1) Graph Analyser and Visualiser: `Graph`
This feature accepts a trigonometry equation (Sinusoidal signal) and outputs the amplitude, frequency, phase, and vertical shift.
It also displays the image of the corresponding graph. 

Format: `Graph [Amplitude]*[Trigo]([Frequency]*x[sign][PhaseShift])[sign][VerticalShift]`

* `Amplitude` can be any positive number. E.g. `15.5`, `4`, `0`
* `Trigo` can be sin, cos or tan. 
* `Frequency` can be any positive number (more than 0). E.g. `100`
  * When entering frequency, one can include ùúã by typing `2*pi*x` instead of `6.283*x`
* `PhaseShift`, `VerticalShift` can be any positive number. E.g. `15.1`, `4`, `0`,`1`
* `sign` can be + or - .
* `[` and `]` are not needed when entering the input.
* Some form of elimination is possible: 
  * When `Amplitude` is 1, `1*cos(1*x)` can be shortened to `cos(1*x)`
  * When `PhaseShift` or `verticalShift` is 0, `[sign][PhaseShift]` or `[sign][VerticalShift]` are not needed.

**Note: Accuracy of graph drawn is up to 4 digits (Thousand place) for numerical inputs. E.g. `9999`.**


Example input 1:
```
Graph 2985*sin(5999*x+2665)-8678
```
Example output 1:
```
This is the amplitude: 2985.0
This is the freq (Hz): 954.7705036082801
This is the phase: 2665.0
This is the vertical shift: -8678.0
```
![img_4.png](ImagesForUserGuide/Graph_eg_output_1.png)

Example input 2:
```
Graph 2*sin(5*pi*x-2)+5.6
```
Example output 2:
```
This is the amplitude: 2.0
This is the freq (Hz): 2.5
This is the phase: -2.0
This is the vertical shift: 5.6
```
![img_5.png](ImagesForUserGuide/Graph_eg_output_2.png)

Example input 3: 
```
Graph cos(5*x)
```
Example output 3:
```
This is the amplitude: 1.0
This is the freq (Hz): 0.7957747154594768
This is the phase: 0.0
This is the vertical shift: 0.0
```

### 2) Matrix Calculation: `Matrix`
This feature accepts matrix equation and outputs calculation result.

Format: `Matrix [Matrix] [operator] [Matrix]`

* `[Matrix]` is the 2 dimensional matrix with integer elements. When you declare the matrix, you should follow the matrix format below:
  ```
  [1,2;3,4]
  ```
    * You should separate the elements with comma (,) in the single row.
    * You should separate the rows with the semicolons.

  ```
  [1,2;3,4].T
  ```
    * You can declare transposed matrix with the transpose annotation `.T`.
    * Transposed matrix above is equal with matrix `[1,3;2,4]`.

  > NOTE : The entities of matrix should be all integer.

  > NOTE : The length of every rows in matrix should be the same with each other.

* `[operator]` is the matrix operator. You can use 4 operators below:
    * `.*` : matrix multiplication
    * `*` : element wise product
    * `+` : matrix addition
    * `-` : matrix subtraction

  > NOTE : Shape of the two operands should be properly matched with each other for the given operator.
  > For the `.*` operator, the number of the columns of operand1 should be the same with the number of the rows of operand2.
  > For the `*`, `+`, and `-` operators, the shape of the two operands should be identical.

#### You can see the right examples of the matrx calculation below:

         0) 5 7 
         1) 9 11 
  ```
* Examples for the matrix subtraction

  *Input* :
  ```
  Matrix [1,2;3,4] - [4,5;6,7]
  ```

  *Output* :
  ```
  Result.

## FAQ

**Q1**: How do I start and run BadMaths?

**A1**: 

- Download the latest release of BadMaths [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F10-2/tp/releases).
- Save the java file to a new folder.
- Open command prompt by typing `cmd` in the Windows search bar.
- Navigate to the folder via `cd "folder path"`. (eg. `cd C:\Users\your_name\Desktop\BadMaths`).
- Type `java -jar BadMaths.jar` to run BadMaths.
- Follow the `User Guide` to begin testing.

**Q2**: How do I exit and leave BadMaths?

**A2**: You can terminate the MathHelp programme by simply typing
`Bye` in the command.

**Q3**: What should I do if the file is corrupted?

**A3**:

- When BadMaths detects that the target file is corrupted, BadMaths will request whether you want to clear the file for 
continual use by print the prompt message
````
Sorry, your notes file seems to be corrupted :(
Do you want to reset the file? (y/n)
````
- You can inform BadMaths whether you want to clear the file by typing `y` or `n`.
- By typing `n` not to empty the file, BadMaths will prompt you for your choice and automatically exit after 
`10 seconds`. In such cases, please correct the file format manually before continuing to use BadMaths.
- By typing `y` to empty the file, BadMaths will prompt you when the target file is successfully emptied, 
and you will be able to continue using BadMaths by then.

**Q4**: In the matrix calculation, can I declare matrix with 3D dimension or above?

**A4**: No. Badmaths only supports 2D matrix in the calculation.

**Q5**: In the matrix calculation, can I declare 1D matrix?

**A5**: No. Badmaths only supports 2D matrix in the calculation. But you can treat 2D matrix with the single row as 1D matrix.
If you declare matrix like `[1, 2, 3]`, the program would recognize it as 2D matrix with shape of `1 * 3`.

**Q6**: In the matrix calculation, can I use multiple operators in single expression like `Matrix [1,2;3,4] + [1,2;3,4] + [1,2;3,4]`?

**A6**: No. Only single operator should be contained in the single expression with two operands.
