PocketPal is an expense tracking tool that allows you to record your financial transactions using the command-line interface. It offers several useful features, including automatic saving and loading of data to ensure data persistence. However, it's worth noting that PocketPal is intended for single-user usage only, as it doesn't have any online database functionality.
