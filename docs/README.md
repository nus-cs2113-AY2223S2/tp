Hi! I am Dr Duke, a command line application that helps you manage your medical records! 
Fell mildly sick and do not wish to queue for long hours at a clinic? Fret not! Just head
down to your local pharmacy and key your symptoms into Dr Duke! Dr Duke will then recommend
you the best medicine for your symptoms!
