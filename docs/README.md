# Taste of Mom's
Taste of Mom's (TOM) is a <strong>desktop recipe manager application for managing recipes, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface</strong> (CLI).

Our application will help students to **keep track and modify recipes** which they can learn to cook, so that they can enjoy the same taste of food made like as if they were at home as they live on campus.
It also helps them filter recipes with ease.
