## Overview
Hello, I'm Prince Pereira, an aspiring Computer Engineer studying at the National University of Singapore. Currently, I'm enrolled in CS2113, where I'm gaining valuable knowledge in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java.

Together with my team members, we have created a product known as Big PC Partpicker (BigPP). The following is a summary of my contributions to the team project Big PC Partpicker.

### Enhancements to BigPP
1. Setup of the skeleton framework for how Classes and objects would interact with each other after discussions with the team.
2. Implement the entire Loading and Saving of data methods within BigPP into the DataStorage Class to be able to handle data appropriately.
3. Setup the framework on how the Parser class will be used to Parse input from the user
4. Setup the Component Class and its respective subclasses such as `cpu`, `gpu`, etc. That will allow for multiple different components to be used for builds
5. Setup the compatibility checks that work in the background to allow users to add components without worry of incompatibilities 
6. Setup how the UI class works and how it will display the content nicely to the user by clearing the previous input from the terminal
7. Setup the PPExceptions to allow the team to develop with exception handling in mind

### Contributions to UG
1. Setup the framework/skeleton for the UG with the appropriate headers for everything
2. Setup the Table of Contents to work properly such that it can link the user to the appropriate sections
3. [Introduction](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md#introduction) for BigPP that links the users to the appropriate pages such as `command`, `compatibility` and the `glossary`.
4. [Getting started](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md#getting-started) guide to intro Users on how to install and operate our software.
5. Instructions on how to use the [Edit Command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md#edit-command) for BigPP which brings the User to the PCBuilder mode
6. Intructions on how to use the [Delete command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md#delete-command) for BigPP which deletes a PC entry
7. Information on how the [Compatibility checker](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md#compatibility-check) works for BigPP with some examples

### Contributions to DG
1. Setup of the skeleton of DG with the appropriate headers for everything
2. Setup the Table of Contents to work properly such that it can link all developers to the appropriate sections
3. Add the [Acknowledgements](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#acknowledgements) section which acknowledges the external libraries we have used
4. Add the [Getting Started](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#getting-started) section that refers the developers to the User Guide for more details

6. Add Class Diagram on [DataStorage Class](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#datastorage-class) to explain how our data is being stored and interacted with in BigPP.
7. Add a sequential Diagram on how data is loaded with an example on [LoadChassis() method](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md#-loadchassis-method-) in DataStorage class
