## Overview
MagusStock is a Java command-line interface (CLI) designed for inventory management. 
This application that I have contributed to developing with my team aims to help store operators, 
IT administrators and logistics managers to manage their inventory more efficiently and effectively. 
While CLI applications are not as user-friendly as GUI applications, they are much faster to use and 
more importantly, portable and can be used on any platform that supports Java.
