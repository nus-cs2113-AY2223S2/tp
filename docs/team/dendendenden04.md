## Project Overview : Sniff

Sniff is a `Command Line Interface (CLI) Appointment Tracker` designed specifically for veterinary clinics in Singapore.
Its main functions are to track various appointments of types: Surgery, Vaccination, & Consultation via UID, date, and appointment type to help clinics better manage their working staff.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Feature**: `list`
    * What it does: Lists out all the appointments available in the appointment handler by date and time.
    * Justification: This feature provides an overview of all the upcoming appointments by date and time. 


* **Feature**: `remove`
    * What it does: Removes an appointment from the appointment handler.
    * Justification: This feature allow users to remove appointments that are cancelled or unwanted.


* **Sub-Feature**: Check for duplicate appointments
    * What it does: It rejects creating appointments that have the same details as those currently in the appointment 
      handler.
    * Justification: It prevents unwanted access of creating two or more duplicate appointments, making it harder for
                     the clinics to keep track. This ensures that a particular appointment only has one UID tagged to
                     it.
  

* **Sub-Feature**: UID generator for the appointments
    * What it does: Generates a 10-character random string with the first character representing appointment type.
    * Justification: This feature helps to automatically generate UIDs for the appointments, which is vital in using
    the application. Various features such as `remove` and `mark` depends on it.
