## Overview

### Project: BrokeMan

BrokeMan is a desktop app for managing expenses, incomes, and personal budget, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface(CLI). 
This program works well for people who need to manage expenses in a very straight forward and intuitive manner.
It is purposely built to display in a very easily readble way.
Such users may include students, working professionals, and your average person.
