## Project: MoneyMaster

MoneyMaster is a finance tracker that offers a variety of easy-to-use features which allow 
users to manage their budget in the most efficient manner. This CLI-based desktop application 
is written in Java and allows users to quickly and effectively monitor their spending, make 
informed financial decisions, and manage their finances.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability clear expenses and future expenses.
    * What it does: Clears the expenses and/or future expenses of all expenses added with a verification if the user would like to proceed with this.
    * Justification: This feature allows the user to clear all their expenses or future expenses all at once rather than deleting them one by one if they have many expenses.


* **New Feature**: Added the ability edit the name of expenses and future expenses.
    * What it does: User is able to change the name of expenses and future expenses.
    * Justification: This feature allows the user to alter the name of (future) expenses in case they misspelled or would like to change the expense name for external reasons.


* **New Feature**: Added the feature so that users can have the ability to list expenses with 'list expense'
  * What it does: Users are able to list the list of expenses or future expenses when entering 'list expense' or 'list future expense' (not needing it to be plural) 
  * Justification: This feature simplifies the common mistype of not pluralizing expense which did not output the list of (future) expenses beforehand
