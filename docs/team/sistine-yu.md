### Enhancements implemented

- I made contributions to the back end of our team's application. 
I designed the income class and the list that stores incomes. After spotting the similarities between my work and my teammates' work, I worked on the refactoring of entry class and entrylist class to make the program structure more resilient and easier to test.
- I intensively participated in implementing the features of listing, adding, editing, deleting entries. 
- I implemented the category class and handled the exception. I also designed the find category method though it's one of the incoming features.
- I wrote part of the testing codes for entry packages.

### Contributions to the UG

- I established the foundational layout of User Guide including introduction, quick start, all the features, FAQ and command summary.

### Contributions to the DG

- I completed the component parts in DG and updated the class diagram and sequence diagram, except the UI component.
- I scrutinized the DG texts and corrected some errors.

### Contributions to team-based tasks

- I was in charge of maintaining the issue trackers and milestone establishment.

### Contributions beyond the project team

- I reviewed the functional codes and developer guides of other teams and gave constructional feedback.
- I tested out other teams' projects and produced informative bug reports.
