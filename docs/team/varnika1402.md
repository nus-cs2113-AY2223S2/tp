## Project: MoneyMaster

MoneyMaster is a CLI based desktop application which allows the users to manage 
their finances quickly and effectively. It is a finance tracker that allows the users to easily monitor
their spending and make informed financial decisions.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete expenses.
    * What it does: Deletes the expenses from the list of expenses based on the expense id entered by the user and updates the balance accordingly.
    * Justification: This feature allows the user to remove any expense entry that are no longer used or added by mistake.


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view expenditure by category.
    * What it does: Displays the total amount spent in each category, allowing users to identify which category is utilizing the most budget.
    * Justification: This feature provides users with insight into their spending patterns and helps them prioritize and optimize their budget accordingly.
