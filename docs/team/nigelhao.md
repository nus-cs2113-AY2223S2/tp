## Project: MoneyGoWhere

MoneyGoWhere is a point-of-sale, desktop app for tracking sales and inventory, optimised for use via a Command line
Interface (CLI). With the ability to type fast and with familiarity of the system, the user will be able to quickly track
sales, check inventory and calculate change. This CLI application is comparable with GUI applications due to its
low-cost and adaptability.

This application is primarily tailored towards the hawker stall owners at The Deck in National University of Singapore.
