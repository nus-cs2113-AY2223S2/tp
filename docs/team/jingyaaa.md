## Project: Meal Companion

MealCompanion is a one-stop solution to a cookbook, ingredient tracker and meal prep handler. The user interacts with it using a CLI.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

* New Feature: Added a `recipe almost` command
  <br/><br/>
  * What it does: allows users to see a list of recipes that they can almost make (i.e. missing a maximum of 3 ingredients)
  * Justification: improves the product by giving users a wider range of potential recipes that they can make
  <br/><br/>
* New Feature: Added a `recipe need` command
  <br/><br/>
  * What it does: allows users to see a list of ingredients that they are missing to make a recipe
  * Justification: improves the product by allowing users to easily find out what additional ingredients they need to make a specific recipe
  <br/><br/>
* New Feature: Added a `recipe find` command
  <br/><br/>
  * What it does: allows users to search for a recipe by its name
  * Justification: improves the product by allowing users to easily find a specific recipe or type of recipe and it's/their index(es) by a portion of the name
  <br/><br/>
* New Feature: Added ability for user to save data
  <br/><br/>
  * What it does: saves all ingredients objects added to the ingredients list to text file in JSON format
  * Justification: users are able to save their progress and transfer data between devices
  <br/><br/>
