## Overview: Project Clanki

Clanki is a command line application to store flashcards used for
memorising information and concepts. The user can interact with
the app by typing commands into their terminal.

### Summary of Contributions

**New feature:** Added `delete` function to remove flashcards

- What it does: The `delete` allows users to remove a specified
  flashcard from the existing list. Typing "delete" will show the full
  list of existing flashcards, and prompts the user for the index of
  the flashcard to be deleted. The user can include a query, or keyword,
  to find the relevant questions and narrow down the search list.
- Justification: This feature greatly improves the product as users can
  easily remove the unnecessary flashcards and study only what is relevant.
- Highlights: This feature helps reduce the clutter of flashcards, either
  from obsolete flashcards or cards that were added erroneously.
