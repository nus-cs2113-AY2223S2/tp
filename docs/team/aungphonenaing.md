## Overview
Taste of Mom's (TOM) is a **desktop recipe manager application for managing recipes**, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

Our application will help students to **keep track and modify recipes** which they can learn to cook, so that they can enjoy the same taste of food made like as if they were at home as they live on campus.
It also helps them filter recipes with ease.

### Enhancements Implemented
* **New Feature**: View recipe by name
  * **Description**: Allows users to view a specific recipe by searching for 
      its name in the following manner, "view \<recipe name\>".
  * **Justification**: This feature adds more versatility to the recipe manager.
      Previously, users will have to find the index of the recipe before viewing
      the contents of it, but now if users know the exact name of the recipe,
      they may view it directly instead. However, in the event there are duplicate
      recipe names, there will be a prompt to search for the recipe index using
      the Find feature and use the recipe index to view by index.
