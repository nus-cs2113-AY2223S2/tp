## Overview
**SecureNUS**, a Command Line Interface (CLI) based password manager for students in National University of
Singapore (NUS) to store and refer to their passwords in a jiffy.

The application offers various functionalities such as creating, removing, displaying, finding, storing, and 
retrieving passwords, as well as modifying password information.

Additionally, the app provides a menu function that displays summaries and syntax for commands.

Users can easily navigate and operate the app, which is designed to be user-friendly and effective.
