## Overview

BagPacker is a desktop Command Line Interface (CLI) application used to manage a user's packing list.
It stores a packing list, edit the quantities packed and the total quantity packed of an item, and searches the packing list for items.
It is written in Java, and has about 4 kLoC.

## Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

New Feature: `editquantity`
* What it does: allows the user to edit the total quantity of an item at the index specified
* Justification: this feature improves the product significantly as there was no way to reduce the total quantity of an item in the packing list
  * Repeated `add` commands can be used to increase the total quantity of an item, but not reduce it
* Highlights: users are able to edit the total quantity of an item to be packed, without having to delete the current item and add the item again

New Feature: `list`
* What it does: prints the entire packing list to the user
* Justification: this feature improves the product significantly as there was no way for the user to view the entire packing list
* Highlights: users can see each item's index, current quantity packed, total quantity to be packed, and item name
