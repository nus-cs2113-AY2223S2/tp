## Project: Meal360
### Overview
Meal360 is a desktop app for managing your recipes, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Meal360 can get your recipe management
tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project:
