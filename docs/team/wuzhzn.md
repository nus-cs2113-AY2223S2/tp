- Team contribution

#### Added features:
  - Venue, Storage, Parser, Event and Command classes
    - The base code and the general flow of the programme
  - Load samples and the venue list creation logic 
    - The load samples adds a much needed functionality for users to be able to try out the commands readily.
    - The venue list creation is done by adding individual venues into an array list and returning that array list. This is done as we felt that the venue list should be fixed and not be editable by users. 
    - Potential development: Update the venue list to be dynamic/have more entries
  - Purge 
    - Helps users to clear all the company list data previously saved in the text file
    - Potential development: Purge by industry/size
  - List venue 
    - Helps user to see the list of venues that he can choose, which is supplemented with choose venue command
  - Added Event and EventDetailsStorage class
      - The Event class is essential for users to keep track of all the event details when the programme runs, while the EventDetailsStorage class manages the saving and updating of the text file that containes the event details.
  - Choose venue command
      - This command helps users to update the venue for their event.
