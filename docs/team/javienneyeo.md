## Overview of Product
- Clanki is a study tool to help students with content heavy subjects with a lot of memorization required. It is
  able to add the questions and answers into flashcards, allowing users to review them when ready.

### Summary of Contributions
- **New feature:** Added the ability to update the question, answer or due date of a flashcard
    - What it does: The feature prints out a list of flashcards that contains the query in its question, 
      answer or due date. The feature than allows the user to choose which flashcard to update and how they 
      want it to be updated. The user is able to change the question, answer or due date part of the flashcard.
    - Justification: This feature is required for users to make any changes to the flashcard. Without 
      this feature, the user would have to delete the flashcard and add a new flashcard in the event the 
      user wants to change the question, answer or due date.
    - Highlights: Reduces the number of flashcards the user has to look through to find the specific flashcard 
      he/she wants to update as the feature prints out the list of flashcards that have that matching query. 
      In addition, the feature searches for the query in the question, answer and due date. JUnit test codes are 
      also written for this feature.
- **New feature:** Added the ability to list out the flashcards the user has added
    - What it does: This feature allows the user to print out all flashcards that the user currently has or 
      print out all the flashcards that is due on a certain date
    - Justification: This allows the user to have a broad overview of all the flashcards that he/she has 
      added to the list. This is to allow the user to check for whether they have added duplicates into the 
      list or to check whether the contents of the flashcards are all correct before reviewing them.
    - Highlights: The user is able to view all the flashcards that are due on a certain day by entering 
      this date as an input. This is to allow the user to view all the flashcards with that due date to 
      revise before reviewing it using the review feature. JUnit test codes are also written for this feature.
- **New feature:** Added the ability to delete all flashcards in the current list of flashcards. 
    - What it does: Allows the user to remove all flashcards that have been added in the list to create a new 
      list of flashcards
    - Justification: In the event the user has many flashcards in his/her list and wants to delete all of 
      it to start a new list, the user is able to use this function and would not need to delete the 
      flashcards one-by-one. It also allows the user to start a new list of flashcard with just one command.
