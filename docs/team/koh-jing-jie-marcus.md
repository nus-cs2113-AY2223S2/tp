## Project: [LifeTracker](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-W15-1/tp)
Our project, LifeTracker, is a calorie tracker CLI program. It allows the user to record down their daily net calorie gain, where the user can input the meals
he has consumed as well as the exercises that he has done.

In doing so, the user can better manage his daily calorie gain in order to meet their particular needs.

## Summary of Contributions

### Commands
Commands are the ways in which the user interacts with our program, through the usage of particular inputs that are defined as commands.
These are the main commands that I worked on.

`filter` command
* Allows the user to filter meals based on their calorie content

`examples` command
* Displays examples of exercises and meals

### Database
* Added the `ExampleData` database to store examples of meals and exercises to be used in the `examples` command

### Contribution to team-based tasks
Implemented the Ui used for LifeTracker, as well as the Ui for the indivdual commands. The Ui is used to improve the accessibility of the program to any potential users,
to ulimately make the program easier to use by streamlining the process for the user. The Ui consists of:
* General Ui - Handle the general commands as well as start up and exit of the program
* Calorie Ui - Handle the Ui for the commands relating to calories
* Exercise Ui - Handle the Ui for the `exercise` command
* Weight Ui - Handle the Ui for the commands that involve the weight of the user
* Example Ui - Handle the Ui for the `examples` command

## UG/DG
* Added Documentation for the `filter` and `examples` command

* Added explanation of program and user stories
