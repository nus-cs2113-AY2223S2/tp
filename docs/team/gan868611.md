## Overview

MoneyMoover is a **CLI application for managing and transferring international currencies**, optimized for use via a
Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the features of other money management applications.

Our app will help students to **track their expenses and income** in order to stay within their budgets, so that they
have enough money to travel.
It will also help them convert to foreign currencies so they can see how much they have to spend overseas.
