## Project: Pet Tracker

Pet Tracker is a Command Line Application to help keep track of multiple pets.
This project is intended to be used by people who own multiple pets like pet sitter or pet hotels.
This project tracks the Pets and also tasks to reminder users about tasks they need to do like feeding their pet,
with a reminder system in place for overdue tasks.
