## Project: Modganiser

Modganiser is effortless module planning at your fingertips via the Command Line Interface (CLI), focused on helping Information Security Undergraduates graduate in 4 years. It does so by giving you a platform to plan all 4 years of your modules to ensure that you meet your graduation requirements.
Build on Java and Modganiser can definitely get your module plan up faster than traditional GUI apps if you can type fast.
