### Overview

Modganiser is effortless module planning, at your fingertips via the 
Command Line Interface (CLI), focused on helping Information Security 
Undergraduates graduate in 4 years. It does so by giving you a platform
to plan all 4 years of your modules to ensure that you meet the graduation
requirements (Core/UE/GE/Internships).

2. **Enhancements implemented:**

   * [ManPage class](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113T-T09-4/tp/pull/69)
   constantly needing to update it as the features change
   and split the features up so the manpage is easier to look at 
   * Method in InputChecker (checkManPageInput()) to check User's Input is valid
     for the manpage command before it uses its respective ManPage methods
   * Method in Command (manPageCommand()) to ensure the appropriate number of fields are used
     and a valid user input is used
   * A new type of module that handles [Internships](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113T-T09-4/tp/pull/69) 
   such as ATAP and SIP 
   * Exceptions for ManPage Inputs 
   * Exceptions to accept only 0-6 ,8 ,12 mcs
   * Exceptions to handle [duplicate names](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113T-T09-4/tp/pull/71)
   but different module types
   * [Bye command](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113T-T09-4/tp/pull/65)
   * [JavaDoc](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113T-T09-4/tp/pull/122)
   * [PE-D bugs](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113T-T09-4/tp/pull/242)
