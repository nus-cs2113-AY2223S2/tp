## Overview
Our project, LifeTracker, is a calorie tracker CLI program. It allows the user to record down their daily net calorie gain, where the user can input the meals
he has consumed as well as the exercises that he has done.

In doing so, the user can better manage his daily calorie gain in order to meet their particular needs.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
