#### Enhancements implemented:

* **New feature**: Added the ability to add dishes to a list of dishes
  * What it does: It allows the user to add information about a dish, which consists of: name of dish, price of dish, and a list of ingredients it is made up of. The dish is then updated into the list of dishes recorded in the program.
  * Highlights: This feature requires parsing of multiple arguments. In paricular, it contains a need to store a list of ingredients, which is challenging to parse as it is a more complex data structure that can have a greater varied range of valid and invalid inputs to parse.

* **New feature**: Added the ability to view all the dishes in the list of dishes currently stored.
  * What it does: It prints to the console the dishes that are currently stored in the list in order.

* **New feature**: Added the ability to delete a dish from the list using an index.
  * What it does: It finds the dish to be deleted via the index given by the user of where the dish is located in the list of dishes.

* **New feature**: Added the ability to find dishes containing a keyword in the list of dishes currently stored.
  * What it does: It allows the user to find dishes that contains a particular keyword.
