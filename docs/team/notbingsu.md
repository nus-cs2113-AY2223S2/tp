## Project: Meal360

### Overview

Meal360 is a desktop app for managing your recipes and weekly meal plans, optimized for use via a Command
Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Meal360 can get your recipe management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
