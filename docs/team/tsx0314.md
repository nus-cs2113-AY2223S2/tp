## Project: Food Supply Tracker

### Overview
Food Supply Tracker(FST) is a desktop food list tracking the expiry date of the food in the list.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) . 
If you can type fast, FST can get your food management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

### Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

+ New Features: `Food `Class and `FoodList` Class
  + Created a Food Class with basic attributes, such as `name` and `expiryDate`
    + Enhancements:`FoodCategory` Class is added to give more opportunities for the attributes of Food.
  + Created a FoodList Class with basic attributes.

+ New Feature: Add Feature (add food items in the food list)
  + What it does: It allows the user to add food item with details. For example, the user can add expiry date and so on. 
  + Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because usually a user may forget what it is put into the list
  , and it is inconvenient for user to 'list' all items at once, and check through all the products. 
  With the parameter of 'expiry date', it allows users to immediately know which products will be soon and consume it 
  as soon as possible. 
  + Enhancements implemented: 
    + Add command line check to prevent bad input.
    + Allow users to add additional details, including `category`and `quantity`.
    + Check the date validation and quantity validation to prevent food items with 
unreasonable date and quantity from adding to the list.
    + Add Javadoc comments for Add Command classes and its methods. Add JUnit tests for AddCommand.

+ New Feature: Exit Command (exit the application)
  + What it does: It allows the user to exit the programme
  + Justification: It is a must-have feature that allows users to exit the programme as they want to.
  
+ Other: Overall flow of the application
  + Complete the skeleton code of `FoodSupplyTracker`, including `FoodSupplyTracker`,`Food`,`FoodList`,`Ui`, `Command` and `FSTException`.
  + `run()` is inspired by the sample code from [CS2113 website](https://nus-cs2113-ay2223s2.github.io/website/schedule/week7/project.html). 
+ Code contributed: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=tsx0314&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2023-02-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=tsx0314&tabRepo=AY2223S2-CS2113-W13-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
