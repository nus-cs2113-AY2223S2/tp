## New Feature: Edit Tasks [#72](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T11-3/tp/pull/72)
- What it does: Allows the user to edit task description or dates after they have already been added
- How it works: The user can edit tasks by date or description
- Justification: If the user feels the date or description is inaccurate, they can update it to maintain an accurate and current schedule

## New Feature: Schedule [#80](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T11-3/tp/pull/80)
- What it does: Displays all tasks that have a deadline in the order of their deadline
- How it works: It sorts the tasks by deadline then iterates through them
- Justification: Users are often most-concerned with their most pertinent tasks, so this easily formats the task in order of how pressing they are
