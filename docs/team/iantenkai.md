## Overview

Inka is a CLI-based software that allows users to add Cards containing questions and answers, attach tags into each Card
and put groups of cards into a deck. Inka aims to help students revise for their exam by providing a flashcard-like
experience.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Storage - Save/Export

- ***What it is :***
  Stores all of Inka's saved data in a `JsonObject` and writes it to 2 read-only files in the filesystem: `savedata.json` and a hidden `savedata_backup.json`

- ***Value :***
  - Enables app data to persist after the app has been closed, allowing users to pick up from where they have left off.
  - Storing the data in the `Json` format allows the save file to be readable, having the added effect of making debugging easier. 
  - Storing the data as`Json` also lets the function easily adapt to changes to various Classes used in Inka such as `Card` and `DeckList`, allowing new class members to be added during development without disrupting testing.
  - Allows users to transfer their saved data into another computer
  - The hidden backup file introduces redundancy and lets the programme function properly if the original savefile becomes corrupted or is altered.

#### 2. Storage - Load

- ***What it is :***
  Reads a `savedata.json` file in the same directory as Inka to extract the app data stored within it.

- ***Value :***
  - Inka can now extract the relevant fields within the json to reconstruct the `CardList`, `TagList` and `DeckList` objects that store user data.
  - If `savedata.json` is found to be corrupted, the hidden `savedata_backup.json` is loaded instead, letting the programme be more reliable.
#### 3. Abstracted conversion with `MemoryToJson` and `JsonToMemory`

- ***What it is :***
  Operations for converting app data into Json Objects and vice versa are abstracted to be contained within 2 classes

- ***Value :***
    - Storage functions can now more easily adapt to suit changes in Data types required for the app's logic.
