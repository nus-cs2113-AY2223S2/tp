### Features Implemented:
* **New Feature**: Parsing of User Input
    * What it does: Enables the application to interpret user commands and determine the corresponding actions to perform
    * Justification: This feature is essential to our application as it enables the execution of various actions based on user input
    * Highlight: Future addition of new commands is made easy by this implementation

* **New Feature**: Add the user interface for events/modules
    * What it does: The selected modules and lessons of users can be viewed in a timetable format
    * Justification: The visual display enables users to check for any schedule conflicts and ensure that their planned events and selected modules fit their timetable
    * Highlight: It was incredibling challenging to develop the application's logic to create a timetable from the user's planned events and selected modules, which is a significant feature of our application, as it allows users to generate a well-formatted timetable straight from the command line interface

* **New Feature**: Implement User Interface and Logger
  * What it does: Displays all texts that is shown to users, including banner welcome message, instructions, etc. Creates a log file for tracking purposes
