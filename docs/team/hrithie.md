### Features Implemented:
* **New Feature**: Parsing of User Input
    * What it does: Enables the application to interpret user commands and determine the corresponding actions to perform
    * Justification: This feature is essential to our application as it enables the execution of various actions based on user input
    * Highlight: Future addition of new commands is made easy by this implementation

* **New Feature**: Implement Add Module slots
  * What it does: Requests for the semester user is in and only allows user to select module and slots that are available within that particular semester
  * Justification: This is a core feature to enable users to add modules from modules displayed on NUSMods that have been extracted by my team member, Matthew
  * Highlight: User is able to select specific slots based on the module code, class number and lecture type. This feature supports all possible lesson types as follows:

| Lesson name                | Name on NUSMODS | Lesson type to input into Command line |
|----------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Lecture                    | LEC             | `LEC`                                  |
| Sectional Teaching         | SEC             | `SEC`                                  |
| Design Lecture             | DLEC            | `DLEC`                                 |
| Recitation                 | REC             | `REC`                                  |
| Packaged Lecture           | PLEC            | `PLEC`                                 |
| Seminar-Style Module Class | SEM             | `SEM`                                  |
| Tutorial                   | TUT             | `TUT`                                  |
| Tutorial Type 2            | TUT2            | `TUT2`                                 |
| Packaged Tutorial          | PTUT            | `PTUT`                                 |
| Laboratory                 | LAB             | `LAB`                                  |

* **New Feature**: Add the user interface for events/modules
    * What it does: The selected modules and lessons of users can be viewed in a timetable format
    * Justification: The visual display enables users to check for any schedule conflicts and ensure that their planned events and selected modules fit their timetable
    * Highlight: It was incredibling challenging to develop the application's logic to create a timetable from the user's planned events and selected modules, which is a significant feature of our application, as it allows users to generate a well-formatted timetable straight from the command line interface

* **New Feature**: Implement User Interface and Logger
  * What it does: Displays all texts that is shown to users, including banner welcome message, instructions, etc. Creates a log file for tracking purposes
  * Justification: The text display makes it easier for users to understand the application and interact with it accordingly. The logging is great for users/developers to check and ensure commands are being executed properly that their planned events and selected modules fit their timetable
  * Highlight: -

* **New Feature**: Implement Help command
  * What it does: Displays user guide on the command line interface
  * Justification: This command makes it easier for users to understand how the application commands work without having to open another tab to refer to the user guide
  * Highlight: -

### Contributions to User Guide:
