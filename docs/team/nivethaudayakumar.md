   * **`What it does:`** Save all Appointments that are marked as done into an Archive Save File (different from Appointments Save File). 
   Load Archive Save File when Sniff starts and read in Archived Appointments. When user types **`archive`** on the CLI interface, it shows the list of archived appointments.
   * **`Justification:`** This feature improves the product significantly by providing users with a convenient way to view all completed appointments.
   * **`Highlights:`** This enhancement also allows users to also export their data to a different computer.
