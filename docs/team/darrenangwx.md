#### Enhancements implemented:  
* **New Feature**: Created the base skeleton of the project and the initial logic of how the program interacts with other components.
  * What it does: It includes the initial project layout of packages such as `commands`, `common`, `dinerdirector`, `exceptions`, `manager`, `ui`, `utils`. 
  * Justification: Allows my teammates to work on the features that they were assigned without thinking too much about how each feature will gel with one another.
* **New Feature**: Added initial logic for `DinerDirector`, `TextUi`, `Parser`.
  * What it does: `DinerDirector` is the main starting class for the program while `TextUi` and `Parser` is required for the interactions within the program.
  * Justification: Allows my teammates to use the `TextUi` and `Parser` template when it comes to implementing their individual commands.
* **New Feature**: Added `exit` command.
  * What it does: `exit` command allows the user to terminate the application successfully and gracefully.
  * Justification: This is a command required to allow the user to exit the application once they are done using it.
* **New Feature**: Added `help` command. 
  * What it does: `help` command allows the user to view a list of commands that are available to use within the application.
  * Justification: This command is required as it allow the user to view a list of commands that are available from within the application so that they won't be confused and second guess what commands are available to use in the application.
* **New Feature**: Added Storage feature for `deadlines`, `meetings`, `staff`, `dishes` 
  * What it does: Allows persistent storage of the data the user inputted across different sessions of the application.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to store data in the application. Hence, the user would not have to retype what they typed previously into each of the list everytime the application starts itself up.
