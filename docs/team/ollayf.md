## Overview
**SecureNUS**, a Command Line Interface (CLI) based password manager for students in National University of
Singapore (NUS) to store and refer to their passwords in a jiffy.

The application offers various functionalities such as creating, removing, displaying, finding, storing, and
retrieving passwords, as well as modifying password information.

### Summary of Contributions
- **New Feature**: Adding, Utilising of 2nd level secrets
    - These include: Crypto wallet, Credit Card, WiFi
    - What it does: Allows the user to create more different types secrets
    - Justification: This allows the user to create secrets with more variety that are typically used commonly in the 
daily life of a student
    - Highlights: This was challenging as it forced a lot more checking on everyone's parts to ensure all the operations
- **New Feature**: Operation Cancel
  - What it does: Cancel an Operation that requires multi line of input
  - Justification: This allows the user to stop creating a secret mid way, for example, because they input things wrong
or they did not want to save this password anymore
  - Highlights: This was challenging as I had to make sure it worked for all operations that require multi line input.
 However, this idea actually came up from User Acceptance Testing when I asked a friend to review the application.
 Among many other suggestions, this was chosen as it was critical to them yet somethings that could be adapted quickly.
