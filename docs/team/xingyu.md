### Enhancements implemented

- **Exception handling**:
  - What it does: Enable the application to show error messages when the input is incorrect or illegal.
  - Justification: This feature is essential in our application as it is important in making our code robust.
  - Highlight: User can see the detailed reason for their wrong input.
- **Refactor edit and add command to support unordered field inputs**
  - What it does: Make the user able to input command without considering the order of `-st`(start time), `-sd`(start day) and so on.
  - Justification: If the user considers input order too much, it may make them annoyed and the code application is not user friendly.
- **feature: Venue**
  - What it does: Allow users to manage the venue of their own courses, so that users can view the location of the event and better manage their tasks.
  - Justification: Each event is accompanied with an event, so it is important for users to manage their event location in the application.
  - Highlight: Make the user able to manage their event, and the UI is quite clear because NUSPlanner can show their event in another line and aligned.
