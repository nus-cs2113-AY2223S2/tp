## Design & implementation

### Architecture
![PocketPal Architecture](./static/PocketPalArchitecture.png)
![Backend Overview](./static/backend/BackendOverviewClassDiagram.png)

### Communication
This project uses a simplified HTTP model, where the frontend sends a `Request` to the backend to perform data-related operations. The backend returns a `Response`, which is then processed by the frontend

![Simplified HTTP Model](static/communication/SimplifiedHTTPClassDiagram.png)

### Data
We use the `EntryLog` data structure to keep track of the entries entered by the user.

![Data Structure Class Diagram](./static/data/DataStructureClassDiagram.png)

### Backend

The backend uses a simplified RESTful API approach. This allows us to decouple code using the proven industry practices.

![Backend](./static/backend/BackendClassDiagram.png)

To find out more, visit the following sections:
- [API](#api)
- [Add, modify, view or delete an entry - `GET`](#add-modify-view-or-delete-an-entry)
- [Access all entries available - `DELETE`, `GET`, `PATCH`, `POST`](#access-all-entries-available)

### API
#### Endpoints

![Endpoints](./static/backend/EndpointClassDiagram.png)

Each endpoint is an child class `Endpoint`. Currently there are 2 endpoints available:

| Endpoint   | Method to call          |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| `/entry`   | `callEntryEndpoint()`   |
| `/entries` | `callEntriesEndpoint()` |

##### Creating a request

- To create a request, simply instantiate `seedu.pocketpal.communication.Request`
  with the desired request method.
- If there are any parameters associated with the request, you may add them using `addParam()`

```java
Request req = new Request(RequestMethod.PATCH);
req.addParam(RequestParams.EDIT_DESCRIPTION, "mango juice");
```

##### Making a request

- To call each endpoint, pass the `Request` into its corresponding method in the frontend.
- A `Response` will be returned to the frontend.

> All request body and parameter data should be serialised with `String.valueOf()` if not specified.

```java
Backend backend = new Backend();
Response res = backend.callEntryEndpoint(req);

if (res.getResponseStatus() != ResponseStatus.OK) {
// handle status        
}

Entry entry = EntryParser.deserialise(res.getData());
// process entry
```

#### Access all entries available
##### Get recent or all entries

`GET /entries`

__Body__

Number of recent entries to view if present, otherwise all entries will be returned.

__Parameters__

__`GET_SIZE`__ boolean

- If present, response will contain the number of entries.
- Otherwise, the following filters will be applied to the entries:

__`FILTER_BY_AMOUNT_START`__ double

- If this is the only parameter, it will be used as a minimum amount filter.
- If both filter amount parameters are present, it will be used as a amount range filter.

__`FILTER_BY_AMOUNT_END`__ double

- If this is the only parameter, it will be used as a maximum amount filter.
- If both filter amount parameters are present, it will be used as a amount range filter.

__`FILTER_BY_CATEGORY`__ Category

- Filter entries by category

__`FILTER_BY_QUERY`__ String

- Filter entries by user query

### Automated Testing

We adopt the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern for unit tests in this project. 
This allows us to achieve a structured unit tests while balancing code readability and maintainability, and allowing a clear separation of the setup, operations and results. 
For backend testing, we use utility classes such as `EntryTestUtil` and `BackendTestUtil` to reduce code repetition and to simplify the testing process.

__Example:__
  ```java
  @DisplayName("Test /entries [GET]")
  class TestEntriesGet extends EntryTestUtil {
      private static final EntryLog expectedEntryLog = new EntryLog();

      @BeforeEach
      void init() {
          TEST_BACKEND.clearData();
          expectedEntryLog.clearAllEntries();
      }

      @Test
      void entriesEndpointGET_recentEntries_correctEntries() {
          // Arrange
          addEntry(ENTRY_1);
          addEntry(ENTRY_2);
          addEntry(ENTRY_3);
          addEntry(ENTRY_4);
          expectedEntryLog.addEntry(ENTRY_3);
          expectedEntryLog.addEntry(ENTRY_4);

          // Act
          Request request = new Request(RequestMethod.GET); // recent 2 entries
          request.addParam(RequestParams.NUM_ENTRIES, "2");
          Response response = TEST_BACKEND.requestEndpointEntries(request);
          EntryLog returnedEntryLog = EntryLogParser.deserialise(response.getData());

          // Assert
          assertEquals(response.getResponseStatus(), ResponseStatus.OK);
          assertTrue(isSameEntryLog(expectedEntryLog, returnedEntryLog));
      }
  }
  ```
  
### Parser

The `Parser` class is a fundamental component instantiated as soon as PocketPal is initialised. Its __purpose__ is to
convert the user's input into structured data which then produces clear instructions for the rest of the program.

Some of its core features include:

- Breaking down user input and extracting the relevant data for further processing.
- Performing input validation and error handling to ensure that input data is in the correct format and ready to be
  processed.
- Converting the input data into the correct format and returning it as a `Command` class to be further processed by the
  application.

Here's a class diagram that shows the core structure of the `Parser` class.

![ParserClassDiagram](../../ParserClassDiagram.png)

How `Parser` works:

1. When a user enters a command, the `Frontend` uses `Parser` to resolve the user input via `parseUserInput()`.
2. Within `parseUserInput()`, the corresponding `parseXCommand()` (`X` is a placeholder for the various command
   names[^1] e.g. `parseAddCommand()`, `parseDeleteCommand()`.)  is invoked to validate that the user input is in the
   correct format. Any exceptions will be thrown and their corresponding error messages will be shown to the user via
   the `ui` class.
2. If the user input is valid, an `XCommand` object containing the relevant data is created and returned.
   E.g. `parseAddCommand()` would create a `AddCommand` object containing the description, price and category.
3. From there, the `XCommand` is ready to be executed by the program. (All `XCommand` classes inherit from `Command` and
   have corresponding `execute()` that carry out their specific instructions.)

[^1]: A list of currently supported commands in PocketPal can be found [here](../../UserGuide.html/features/)

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Parser` component when a user inputs the following
command: `/add McDonalds -c Food -p 10.50`

## Non-Functional Requirements

## Glossary

* *glossary item* - Definition

## Instructions for manual testing

## Testing with sample data (from file)

PocketPal stores data in a *storage.txt* file under the "*data/*" directory. Each row in the "*storage.txt*" file
represents a single expense Entry. Each column in each row should have 3 columns, representing the *description* of the
Entry, *amount* associated with the Entry and *category* of the Entry in that order, and are separated with the ","
delimiter. All of them are in the String format.

An example *storage.txt* file that will be readable by PocketPal is as such:

'''
Apple Juice,5.50,Food
Bus Card,50,Transportation
Paracetamol,10.39,Medical
'''

which will give us 3 Entries.

As of the time of writing, the available categories are:

- Clothing
- Entertainment
- Food
- Medical
- Others
- Personal
- Transportation
- Utilities
- Income

An empty input for category is not allowed. If necessary, use the "Others" category.

## Exceptions

Exceptions are thrown for a couple of cases where files are being read. If you wish to test the exceptions, they can be
replicated as follows:

1. Delimiter is invalid: If the delimiter is not the comma (","), it is not recognised as a delimiter and will not be
   processed correctly.
   Example row: Apple Juice|5.50|Food - In this case, the pipe ("|") is used as a delimiter, which is not allowed.
2. Amount is invalid: If the amount is not a numeric, it is not recognised as a valid amount and will not be processed
   correctly.
   Example row: Apple Juice,5A6B,Food - In this case, the amount is "5A6B", which is not a numeric and therefore not
   allowed.
3. Category is invalid: If the category is not a string from the list of allowed categories (see above), it is not
   recognised as a valid category and will not be processed correctly.
   Example row: Apple Juice,5.50,Drink - In this case, the category is "Drink", which is not a valid category and
   therefore not allowed.
4. Not enough columns: If a row has insufficient columns compared to what is needed, the Entry cannot be created.
   Example row: Apple Juice,5.50 - In this case, there are only two categories which is not allowed.

# Launching of PocketPal
