# Design & implementation

<!-- @@author haoyangw -->

## Application Lifecycle

### Overview

The overall execution lifecycle of the WellNus application involves 4 main components, as shown in the diagram below.

![Application Lifecycle](diagrams/WellnusSequence.png)

The application begins with a call to `WellNus.start()`, which initialises an instance of `MainManager` and calls the
`MainManager.runEventDriver()` method.

`MainManager.runEventDriver()` will then take control of user input and provide a basic interface that parses commands
from the user. This basic interface only supports basic commands such as `help` and `exit` and recognises the keywords
of all supported features in WellNUS++. When a recognised feature keyword is given, the corresponding `FeatureManager`
will be activated through its `runEventDriver()` method, which gains control of user input from `MainManager`. On the
other hand, `MainManager.runEventDriver()` terminates when the `exit` command is given, after which the user exits from
the application.

After control of user input is granted by `MainManager`, `FeatureManager.runEventDriver()` provides the user with a
feature-specific user interface that continuously parses user commands to determine the suitable `Command` class to
handle any given command. In the case of supported commands besides 'home', the `execute()` method of the corresponding
`Command` class is called to perform a particular action requested by the user. On the other hand, the `home` command
will terminate the `FeatureManager.runEventDriver()` loop, returning the user to the main WellNus++ interface provided
by `MainManager.runEventDriver()`.

### Rationale

`WellNus` directly transfers control of user input to `MainManager.runEventDriver()` as managing user input is the
expected functionality of the `runEventDriver()` method within a particular implementation of `Manager`, which means
that conceptually, management of user input belongs in a subclass of `Manager` instead. Besides, this abstraction
of user input logic from `WellNus` fulfils the `Single Responsibility Principle` since `WellNus` is intended
to be a high-level class that delegates tasks to specialised classes that provide the expected functionality, and thus
`WellNus` must not be responsible for concrete logic such as managing user input.

Additionally, `MainManager.runEventDriver()` is intentionally restricted to only recognise basic commands and feature
keywords to firstly, achieve the encapsulation and abstraction of feature-specific logic from `MainManager`. Moving
feature-specific logic such as recognising feature-specific commands to corresponding feature `Managers` ensures that
actual implementation details in feature-related subpackages are hidden from `MainManager`. This is necessary for
the purpose of encapsulation since `MainManager` exists in a different subpackage. At the same time, by providing the
public `runEventDriver()` in feature `Managers`, `MainManager` is only aware of the expected functionality of the
`runEventDriver()`, which can be used to support feature-specific commands, without being involved in the implementation
details. This allows `MainManager.runEventDriver()` to be kept abstract while providing the expected functionality of
the application. Secondly, this design fulfils the `Single Responsibility Principle` as `MainManager` is solely
responsible for the main WellNUS++ commands but not any feature-specific ones, which means that its logic will only
be changed for reasons related to the main WellNUS++ commands only.

Lastly, the `runEventDriver()` method of feature `Managers` delegates the execution of commands to implementations of
`Command` to abide by the `Single Responsibility Principle`. Every `Manager.runEventDriver()` method is expected to
provide a particular user interface, but not any commands. This means that this method should only change for reasons
related to its user interface, which requires that command handling logic be implemented elsewhere so that changes in
commands do not require changes in any implementation of `Manager.runEventDriver()`. Besides, this approach ensures
abstraction of logic as `Manager.runEventDriver()` ensures that command handling is performed while avoiding the
actual implementation details by delegating the task to a particular implementation of `Command.execute()`, which is
known to provide command handling functionality.

## UI Component

UI component is in charge of reading in user input and printing output.

### UI Implementation

![UI Class Diagram](diagrams/UiComponent.png)
The `TextUi` superclass is created for printing standard output and error messages. Each feature has its own UI subclass
which
inherits from `TextUi` to support more customised I/O behaviours.<br>
Main WellNUS++ uses TextUi<br>
Atomic Habit uses AtomicHabitUi<br>
Self Reflection uses ReflectUi<br>
Focus Timer uses FocusUi<br>
Gamification uses GamificationUi<br>
For example, the line separator for Self Reflection is `=` and for Atomic Habit is `~`.

## Self Reflection Component

This `Reflection` component provides users with random sets of introspective questions to reflect on, achieving the goal
of improving their wellness.<br>

### Design considerations

#### User design considerations

* The sets of questions generated everytime are designed to be randomised to allow users to reflect on different aspects
  of their lives.
* Users can review the previous set of questions generated and add questions they resonate well into their favorite list
  for review in the future. Similarly, they can also remove questions they no longer resonate from their favorite list
  to
  ensure the relevancy of the list.
* `help` command and prompting messages are available to guide users in using Self Reflection. For example, an alert
  will
  be given to users if they `unlike` a question when their favorite list is empty.

```
============================================================
    The favorite list is empty, there is nothing to be removed.
============================================================
```

* A unique line separator `=` is used to differentiate Self Reflection from other features and give users a better
  visual
  indication.

#### Developer design considerations

* **Abstracted `QuestionList` Class**<br>
  Self Reflection section relies heavily on the set of random sets of questions generated and this set will be shared
  across different classes. A `QuestionList` class is used to store and manipulate the lists of questions such as the
  random sets and the favorite list. A common `QuestionList` object is constructed and passed into different command
  object
  constructors as an argument. As such, information of lists of questions and their associated methods are centralised
  and shared among different objects.
* **Generate random sets and match user input index to real question index**<br>
  Multiple data structures are used randomise the sets of questions. An **ArrayList** of 10 questions
  will be loaded upon launching the program. A **Set** of 5 randomised distinct integers ranging from 0-9 will be
  generated.
  This **Set** of integers are the used as the index of questions in the **ArrayList** to select the corresponding
  questions
  and stored for other usages (e.g. `like`, `unlike` commands).
  The displayed index of questions increments from 1 to 5, which might differ from their real indexes in the ArrayList.
  A **HashMap** is then used with displayed index being the key and real question index being the value to ensure that
  the correct
  question will be mapped to from user input index (i.e. displayed index).
* **User input validation**<br>
  Checking mechanism is used to validate user input. The first validation happens at manager level and
  the `CommandKeyword` will be checked.
  A correct type of command object will be created based on `CommandKeyword`. The second validation happens at command
  level
  to validate arguments and payloads. This is done at command level instead of manager level as different commands might
  have
  different requirements for the inputs.

### Self Reflection Implementation

![Reflection Component Sequence Diagram](diagrams/ReflectionSequenceDiagram.png)
A `ReflectionManager` object is created by the WellNUS++ `MainManager`. It uses a `ReflectUi` and `CommandParser` object
to constantly reads in and interprets user input and create the correct command for execution based on input
command type until a `HomeCommand`. A common `QuestionList`object is shared among command objects to retrieve and modify
user data.

![Reflection Component Class Diagram](diagrams/ReflectionClassDiagram.png)
`ReflectionManager` class:<br>

- The main event driver of **Self Reflection** feature.
- It inherits from abstract `Manager` class to standardise behaviours. For example. `ReflectionManager` needs to
  override a
  standardised abstract method `runEventDriver()` as that this method can be better invoked by the `MainManager`.
- Each `ReflectionManager` object contains exactly one `ReflectUi` object as an attribute to constantly get user inputs.
  This is to
  use a common `Scanner` object (created in the `ReflectUi` object) to read all the user inputs within Self Reflection
  feature. This can avoid potential unexpected behaviours from creating multiple `Scanner` objects.
- The `runEventDriver()` method is the entry of the Self Reflection feature. It contains a **while loop** to
  continuously get user input commands as users are expected to continuously perform a series of actions within Self
  Reflection
  feature until they wish to return back to main WellNUS++ interface(input `home` command).
- Based on the input command type, the `executeCommands()` method will create the correct command objects and
  invoke the execution of these commands. Since the command objects are local variables, they are dependencies
  for `ReflectionManager` class.

`QuestionList` class:<br>

- This class stores the list of 10 `ReflectionQuestion` objects available in Self Reflection. It is in charge of
  retrieving and modifying
  user data related to `ReflectionQuestion` such as the favorite list and the indexes of the previously generated set of
  questions.
- A `ReflectionManager` object has exactly one `QuestionList` object which is then passed by reference to construct
  command
  objects(`LikeCommand`, `GetCommand` etc). Hence, it is a dependency for all command objects in Self Reflection. This
  structure
  allows data to be centralised and well organised by one class.
- By abstracting the above-mentioned attributes and methods as a separate class instead of putting them
  in `ReflectionManager`, the `ReflectionManager` class can solely focus command execution. All the data related to the
  list of questions is taken care of by the `QuestionList` class. As such, Single responsibility can be better achieved.
- A `QuestionList` object has exactly one `Storage` and `ReflectionTokenizer` class to store data into data file upon
  update
  and load data from data file upon launching WellNUS++.

`ReflectionQuestion` class:<br>

- Each introspective question is a `ReflectionQuestion` object.
- It contains the basic description of the introspective question. Being modelled as an object instead of pure string,
  each question will be able to have more attributes which might be utilized for future features.

`ReflectUi` class: <br>

- This subclass inherits from `TextUi` superclass. It allows Self Reflection feature to have more customised output
  behaviour(e.g. type of separators).

`ReflectionCommands` class: <br>

- This represents a collection of all commands in Self Reflection feature, which will be explained in more detail at
  later section.
- Each command class inherits from `Command` abstract class and override `validateComand()` abstract method to validate
  command.
- Commands available in Self Reflection: <br>
  Get a random set of reflection questions: `get`<br>
  Add a particular question into favorite list: `like INDEX`<br>
  Remove a particular question from favorite list: `unlike INDEX`<br>
  View questions in the favorite list: `fav`<br>
  Review the previous set of questions: `prev`<br>
  Help command: `help`<br>
  Return back to main WellNUS++: `home`

#### Self Reflection commands implementation

![Reflection Commands Class Diagram](diagrams/ReflectionCommandsUML.png)

`GetCommand` class: <br>

- Command format: `get`
- This command generates a set of 5 random introspective questions for users to reflect on.
- A `QuestionList` object is passed in as a dependency to provide the pool of 10 introspective questions available
  and generate the set of indexes.

`LikeCommand` class: <br>

- Command format: `like INDEX`
- Users can add reflection question that is generated in the previous set into their favorite list. As there
  will only be 5 questions per random set, the indexes are restricted to integer 1~5.
- The `QuestionList` class is used to as a dependency and `addFavQuestion()` method in called to add and store the data.
- Every time a question is added into the favorite list, the indexes of this particular question will be stored in data
  file straightaway. It prevents data loss due to unforeseen computer shutdown.
- Users can only successfully add a question to favorite list if they have gotten **at least** one set of questions
  previously.

`UnlikeCommand` class: <br>

- Command format: `unlike INDEX`
- Users can remove reflection questions from their favorite list.
- The `removeFavQuestion()` method in `QuestionList` class is used to remove data and the mechanism is similar to `like`
  command.

`FavoriteCommand` class: <br>

- Command format: `fav`
- Users can review the questions in their favorite list.
- The `getFavQuestions()` method in `QuestionList` class is called to retrieve the questions based on the indexes in the
  favorite list.

`PrevCommand` class: <br>

- Command format: `prev`
- Users can review the set of questions generated by the previous `get` command. It only works if users have gotten
  **at least** one set of questions.

`HelpCommand` class: <br>

- Command format: `help [COMMAND_TO_CHECK]`
- Every command class has public attributes `COMMAND_DESCRIPTION` and `COMMAND_USAGE`.
- `printHelpMessage()` method in `HelpCommand` will retrieve and print these attributes.

`HomeCommand` class: <br>

- Command format: `home`
- This command allows users to return back to the main WellNUS++ interface.

## CommandParser Component

The CommandParser is a core feature of WellNUS++.
It defines the following:

1. The syntax for users to input commands
2. A common API for developers to **process** user input

### Design Considerations

The CommandParser is implicitly used by users 100% of the time.
It is the abstraction through which the users will interact with WellNUS++'s features.
Its ease of use is critical to ensure a good user experience.

#### User design Considerations

Our [target user profile](#target-user-profile) are Computing and Engineering students.
With that, we have done extensive research and laid out the following design considerations.

1. **Easy learning curve**  
   Our users are often strapped for time and tend to prefer to use tools that
   they are familiar with or can learn quickly. Our command syntax should be easy
   to remember, predictable and intuitive.
2. **Flexible usage**  
   "Arguments" for a command should not care about the order of arguments.
   Users often type what comes to mind first. Allowing flexible order of arguments
   reduces the cognitive load on the user's end and allows for a
   more pleasant experience.

#### Developer Design Considerations

Virtually every feature in WellNUS++ will require user input to be processed. This means that all features
will have to interact with `CommandParser`. Hence, the
design for the `CommandParser` API must be understandable, unambiguous and easy to develop on.

1. **Easy way to extract components of user input**  
   Each component of userInput (arguments, payload, etc) should be obtainable in predictable and non-arbitrary way.
   Arbitrary way (using index) is not preferred as it is prone to developer erros.
2. **Easy way to validate user input**  
   There should also be built-in ways to easily validate components of user input for a command,
   such as checking length.

#### Alternative Designs Considered

We considered alternative command structures such as [AB3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/UserGuide.html)
where input types are
specified , `e.g. n/John Doe` which more 'secure' from the get go.
However, due to the following issues, AB3 was not chosen as the alternative solution compared to the shell-like
structure.

**Steep learning curve**  
For experienced and inexperienced users, it is a hassle to remember what letter corresponds to what argument.
For AB3, the user needs to remember all the different `char` 'verbs' such as `e/` for email, `n/` for name.
This violates user design consideration (1).

**Does not scale well**  
AB3 structure runs the high risk of argument-space collision as well.  
For example, consider a command that needs an "email" and "entry". What does `e/<payload>` correspond to?
We could simply just put entry as *some other character* -- but that defeats the purpose of having the structure in the
first place as the character is the argument's first character.
This makes behaviour **unpredictable** and a **confusing** user experience.

**Bad expert user experience**

For expert users and CLI-masters, pedantic argument input like AB3 makes the typing experience MUCH slower due to the
need to type which is relatively clunky as the user will need to type far off to the '/' key on the keyboard.

### CommandParser Syntax

The command parser defines any arbitrary user input to be valid
if it follows the following structure.

```
mainCommand [payload] [--argument1 [payload1] --argument2 [payload2] ... ]
```

This should be familiar to you. It is similar to how most CLI applications process arguments.
In particular, we adapt the structure from `unix` style CLI apps. For example, `git --help`'s
output is shown below.

![Example](diagrams/git_command.png)
<figcaption align="center">Example of CLI input syntax, using git as an example</figcaption>

This achieves user design consideration (1). Why?  
This syntax is intuitive at a glance to our target users,
is predictable and easy to remember as the only thing they need to remember is the argument name and
the '--' delimiter.

From this syntax, we can generalise ALL user inputs as `(argument, payload)` pairs.  
`mainCommand` is a special `argument`, where it MUST be the first word in the user input.

Due to the unique one-to-one relationship between arguments and payloads, we can model a user input
using this syntax using a `HashMap` mapping each `argument` to a `payload`.

For example,
`foo bar --arg1 payload1 payload1--1 --arg2 payload2 --arg3`

Will be mapped as:
`(foo, bar), (arg1 payload1 payload1--1), (arg2 payload2), (arg3, "")`
where `""` represents an empty string (for visualization).

Using a `HashMap` fulfils user design considerations (2), both developer design considerations (3), (4).

- (2): Order of arguments do not matter in a HashMap 
- (3): To get a `payload`, the developer simply needs to call `myHashMap.get("argument")`.  
  This syntatic sugar prevents developer errors compared to an index-based approach.
- (4): Validating commands is much less difficult using `HashMap`. For example, size can be checked with
  built-in `.size()`,
  argument existence can be queried with `.containsKey()`.

### Implementation

#### Integration with WellNUS++

![Integration](diagrams/CommandParserClass.png)

`CommandParser` integrates into the boilerplate via the abstract Manager class.  
All features are controlled by a manager subclass - hence the developers just need to call
`getCommandParser` to get a reference to the `CommandParser` taking care of all commands
in the `Manager` subclass.

#### CommandParser API

There are only two methods that developers need to know to use `CommandParser`.

1. `parseUserInput`
2. `getMainArgument`

**Usage: `parseUserInput`**

`parseUserInput` is used to get a `HashMap` representation of the user input, a bijection
between `argument` and `payload` pairs.

Implementation of `parseUserInput`:

![CommandParser implementation](diagrams/CommandParserSequence.png)

**Caveats**: For sake of generalization, `FooUi` and `FooManager` are aliases for the actual implemented `TextUi` and
`Manager` subclasses. For example, `AtomicHabit` and `AtomicHabitManager`.

`parseUserInput(String userInput)` is used to directly convert a string into their argument-payload pairs.
It first calls `splitIntoCommand` to split input over the `' --'` delimiter to get a `String[] commands`.
Each `command` in `commands[]` contain the argument and payload. Internally, it splits the
argument from the payload and populates a `HashMap` with the one-to-one mapping. After all `command`s have
been processed, the map is returned to the `Manager` for usage.

**Sample Code**

```java
// Example usage to get the HashMap
public class FooManager extends Manager {
    public HashMap<String, String> handleCommand(String userInput) {
        // Get a reference to the parser
        CommandParser parser = getCommandParser();
        // Get the one-to-one mapping
        HashMap<String, String> result = parseUserInput(userInput);
        return result;
    }
}
```

**Usage: `getMainCommand(userInput)`**

To understand what the user wants to do, we need a convenient way to get the `mainCommand` from the user input.
The canonical way to do this is to use `getMainCommand`. This defeats adversarial input where the main command
is input as an argument.

Internally, this just splits the string by whitespace and returns the first word in the array.

## AtomicHabit Component

The `AtomicHabit` component is responsible for tracking the user's daily habits
inorder to help users inculcate useful habits.

It consists commands that allows the user keep track of their habits such as adding, updating and more.

### Design Considerations

#### User design considerations

* The output of the `AtomicHabit` component is designed to be simple and informative
  as any changes to their habits will be printed out for the user.
* A variety of commands are provided to allow the user to easily add, update and delete their habits.
* `help` command and prompting messages are available to guide users in using AtomicHabit feature. For example, when
  user
  inputs `list` and there is no habit in the list, the following message will be printed out:

```

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    You have no habits in your list!
    Start adding some habits by using 'add'!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

```

* A unique line separator `~` is used to differentiate AtomicHabit from other features and give users a better
  visual indication.

#### Developer design considerations

* **Abstracted `AtomicHabitList` Class**<br>
  An abstracted `AtomicHabitList` class is created to store the list of habits. This centralised `AtomicHabitList`
  object is
  passed to other objects.This allows the `AtomicHabit` component to be easily extended to support more features in the
  future.
* **Duplicate Checking**<br>
  Duplicate checking is done to prevent the user from accidentally adding the same habit twice. This is done by checking
  if the habit
  already exists in the `AtomicHabitList` object.
* **User input validation**<br>
  Checking mechanism is used to validate user input. User input is always extensively checked
  using the `validateCommand()` method in `Command` class before attempting to prepare or execute any command.

### AtomicHabit Implementation

![AtomicHabitManager Implementation](diagrams/AtomicHabitSequenceDiagram.png)
An `AtomicHabitManager` object is created by the WellNUS++ `MainManager`and takes over control of the application
when user enters the `AtomicHabit` feature. It uses a `AtomicHabitUi` and `CommandParser` object
to constantly read in and interpret user input and create the correct command for execution based on input
command type until a `HomeCommand`. A common `AtomicHabitList`object is initialised by `AtomicHabitManager` and is
shared among command objects to retrieve and modify user data.

![AtomicHabitClass](diagrams/AtomicHabit.png)
Note: For readability, AtomicHabitCommand is an abstraction of all the 6 different commands that exist in AtomicHabit.

#### AtomicHabit Commands

`AddCommand` class: <br>

- Command format: `add --name ATOMIC_HABIT_NAME`
- Users can add new habit to their habit list to track their progress.<br>
- `addAtomicHabit()` method in `AtomicHabitList` will add the habit to the habit list.

`DeleteCommand` class: <br>

- Command format: `delete --id HABIT_INDEX`
- Users can delete habit from their list once they have inculcated the habit.
- `deleteAtomicHabit()` method in `AtomicHabitList` will delete the habit from the habit list.

`HomeCommand` class: <br>

- Command format: `home`
- This command allows users to return back to the main WellNUS++ interface.

`ListCommand` class: <br>

- Command format: `list`
- This command allows users to view all the habits they have added.
- ArrayList of 'AtomicHabit' objects is iterated through and the attributes are printed out.

## Gamification Component

The Gamification feature is supported by the `GamificationManager` class, which delegates specific application logic to
4 main sets of classes: `Commands`, `GamificationData`, `GamificationStorage` and `GamificationUi`.

![Gamification Classes](diagrams/GamificationClassDiagram.png)<br/>

### Design Considerations

Logic related to specific tasks such as user commands, XP data, storage and user interface are delegated by
`GamificationManager` to specialised classes to fulfil the `Single Responsibility Principle` since a `Manager` is only
a high-level abstraction that ensures that a feature provides all the expected functionality. Hence,
`GamificationManager` should change only when the overall specification of the gamification feature changes, not when a
particular task changes(e.g. a change in the gamification feature's user interface style). The design considerations for
each of the 4 sets of specialised classes are as follows.

#### GamificationData

`GamificationData` encapsulates all useful statistics for the gamification feature and exposes them using helper
methods, thus acting as a compound data type. This is done to increase cohesion since all these useful statistics are
computed from the total XP points data, and thus they are all logically related and can be grouped together in one
class.

Additionally, `GamificationData` provides a layer of abstraction between the individual statistics and classes
that access them. This greatly simplifies the code of such classes, which only have to call `GamificationData`'s
helper methods. It also fulfils the Object-Oriented Principles of `abstraction` and `encapsulation`. Firstly,
abstraction of logic for computing the statistics makes classes that access the statistics easier to maintain since only
one class, `GamificationData`, needs to be updated to modify the statistics logic. Secondly, abstraction reduces code
duplication since the common logic for computing statistics can be shared between multiple classes through one single
definition of `GamificationData`. Finally, encapsulation ensures that classes from other packages that access the
statistics do not know the implementation details for computing any of the individual statistics, which is necessary
since such classes are from a different package than `GamificationData`.

#### GamificationStorage

`GamificationStorage` implements logic for storing `GamificationData` into gamification's data file and provides them
using helper methods. This reduces coupling between `GamificationData` and the actual `Storage` and
`GamificationTokenizer` classes by adding a layer of abstraction. The rationale behind this is the fulfilment of the
`Single Responsibility Principle`: changes in the `Storage` and `GamificationTokenizer` helper methods will not
require updates to `GamificationData`, whose responsibility is to provide gamification statistics, not handle data
storage and retrieval.

#### GamificationUi

`GamificationUi` is a child class of `TextUi` and thus provides all of `TextUi`'s functionality while adding
gamification-specific logic such as the XP bar. This design is chosen because the gamification feature requires
`TextUi`'s features, but also needs to customise the format of user messages and introduce additional UI elements.
Extending `TextUi` enables `GamificationUi` to do exactly this, but more importantly, gamification-specific
customisations and logic is abstracted from `TextUi` and put in the `gamification` subpackage. This provides 3
benefits:

1. Gamification's customisations will not affect other classes that call `TextUi`'s methods
2. Other classes(from different subpackages) that access `TextUi` are unable to call on gamification-specific methods
3. Fulfilment of the `Open Closed Principle`: The introduction of `GamificationUi` requires no modifications to
   `TextUi`'s helper methods, but `GamificationUi` provides additional functionality like an XP bar.

#### Commands

The key command for the gamification feature is the `stats` command provided by the `StatsCommand` class. Due to the
implementation of `GamificationData` and `GamificationUi`, `StatsCommand` is a high-level abstraction that delegates
the printing of the XP bar to `GamificationUi`, which obtains the XP statistics to be displayed from the given
`GamificationData`. This greatly simplifies the maintenance of the `StatsCommand` class, which can remain unchanged
even when the logic for computing the XP statistics or the implementation of the XP bar changes. It also reduces
coupling between the `StatsCommand` class and the statistics and UI logic of the gamification feature.

### Alternative Designs Considered

#### Defining gamification statistics logic within `GamificationManager`

Instead of defining a separate `GamificationData` class that is initalised by `GamificationManager`, logic for
computing statistics can be defined within `GamificationManager` itself. This design was discarded because firstly, it
violates the `Single Responsibility Principle`. Implementations of `Manager` are supposed to be high-level abstractions
that delegate tasks to specialised classes. By encapsulating statistics logic within `GamificationManager`, it has to
be updated when the logic for computing the gamification statistics is changed, but the specialised task of computing
statistics is not `GamificationManager`'s responsibility.

Secondly, defining logic for computing statistics within `GamificationManager` requires passing a reference to
`GamificationManager` to other packages such as atomic habits, which updates the user's total XP. This is unacceptable
since `GamificationManager` has access to all of gamification's state, which other features shouldn't have, so it
cannot be passed by reference to other packages.

Finally, this design results in high coupling between `GamificationManager` and other classes such as `StatsCommand`
that require access to gamification statistics. This is unideal since `GamificationManager` is intended to be a high
level abstraction, which means it should be loosely coupled with other classes, and high coupling also makes the
maintenance of `GamificationManager` more difficult.

#### Integrating `GamificationStorage` logic within `GamificationData`

Logic for calling `Storage` and `GamificationTokenizer` to perform data storage and retrieval can be integrated within
`GamificationData`, eliminating the need for a separate class `GamificationStorage`. This design was rejected because
firstly, it violates the `Single Responsibility Principle`. `GamificationData`'s responsibility is to compute
gamification statistics, not perform data storage and retrieval of any kind. However, this design would necessitate
updating the logic in `GamificationData` whenever the `storage` classes are modified, which contradicts the `Single
Responsibility Principle`.

Secondly, this design leads to high coupling between `GamificationData` and `storage` classes such as `Storage` and
`GamificationTokenizer`. This makes maintenance more difficult, as changes in the `storage` classes can create a
larger ripple effect as `GamificationData` also has to be updated.

## Tokenizer

![Tokenizer](diagrams/Tokenizer.png)<br/>
The `Tokenizer` interface is the superclass for classes responsible for converting data stored temporarily in feature's
Managers into Strings for storage and also convert Strings from storage back into data that can be restored by Managers.

### Design Considerations

Each `Tokenizer` provides `tokenize()` and `detokenize()`, which can then be adapted for each feature. This fulfills the
`Single Responsibility Principle` as each `Tokenizer` are only responsible to tokenize and detokenize data from only one
Feature. Furthermore, this design also fulfills `Open-Closed Principle` where `Tokenizer` interface are open for
extension
should there be a new feature added into WellNUS++., while the `Tokenizer` feature itself are closed for modification.
In
addition, this design principle fulfills the `Dependency Inversion Principle` as the feature's Managers are not
dependent on
actual implementation of `Tokenizer`, but on the abstract of `Tokenizer` class and its `tokenize()` and `detokenize()`
method. Each feature's tokenizer are free to implement `tokenize()` and `detokenize()` as every feature might store
different
kinds of data.

### Individual Tokenizers

`AtomicHabitTokenizer` class is responsible to tokenize and detokenize ArrayList of AtomicHabits that
AtomicHabitManager will
use or store. Each habit will be tokenized in the following
format `--description [description of habit] --count [count of
habit]` using the `tokenize()` method. While `detokenize()` method converts the strings back to ArrayList of AtomicHabit
that
can be initialized in AtomicHabitManager to restore the state of the Manager.

`ReflectionTokenizer` class is responsible to tokenize the liked question's index and previous questions's index and
detokenize
it back. ArrayList of Set containing the index of `like` and `pref` will be passed to the `tokenize()` function. The
data will
be stored in the following format

```

like:[index of liked question]
prev:[index of previous question]

``` 

`detokenize()` then can be called by ReflectionManager to retrieve the ArrayList containing the Set of liked and
previous
questions' index to restore its state.

## Storage

Storage is a common API built to work completely decoupled from any `Tokenizer` implementation.

It comes with two methods that developers need to be aware of to save and load data:

- `saveData(ArrayList<String> tokenizedManager, String fileName)`
- `loadData(String fileName)`

### Usage - `saveData`

To illustrate the overall flow on how to save data, refer to the sequence diagram below.
Saving: `saveData`, `Storage` allows for any tokenizing structure logic as long as the input data is in the form
of an `ArrayList<String>`.

The general idea is to `tokenize` it first into the `ArrayList<String>` format calling before
calling `Storage`'s `saveData` method.

`FooTokenizer` and `FooManager` are named as such to generalize the features that use `Storage`. `<T>` is also used to
generalize the data structure that is being
passed into a feature-specific tokenizer, such as `AtomicHabit`.

The burden of data transformation from the target data type to `String` is up to `Tokenizer`'s `tokenize` method.

![](./diagrams/StorageSequence-Saving_Data__Emphasis_on_Storage_Subroutine_.png)
**Caveats**: For sake of generalization, `FooManager` and `FooTokenizer` are aliases for the actual implemented
`Manager` and `Tokenizer` subclasses. For example, `AtomicHabitManager` and `AtomicHabitTokenizer`.

### Usage - `loadData`

`loadData` works similarly to `saveData`, but with the logic reversed.

`loadData` will load all `WellNUS++` data into a common data type, `ArrayList<String>`.
The string list can then be use wholesale or detokenized into an appropriate data structure.

The burden of data transformation from `String` to the target data type to is up to `Tokenizer`'s `detokenize` method.

### Design Considerations

- Only filenames defined by public string constants in the `Storage` class.
  This is meant to prevent developer mis-use and control what exactly waht files WellNUS++ can create.
- Internally, each entry in `ArrayList<String>` will be delimited by ` --\n`, where \n is `System.LineSeparator()`.
  This was chosen due to the invariant property of `' --'` in the context of WellNUS++. Due to the way all user input
  is filtered by the `CommandParser`, the chosen delimiter should never show up in any data input, such as a habit name
  from `AtomicHabits`.

## Focus Timer Component

The `Focus Timer` component is responsible for tracking the user's daily habits.
It consists of the `feature` package and the `command` package.

It contains commands that you would expect from a timer, such as stopping,
pausing, and more.

### Focus Timer Implementation

The focus timer contains a `FocusManager`.
The session is a wrapper for all the `Countdown` and contains utility logic to identify state and manage Countdown.
`Countdown` houses the timer that actually does the counting and holds attributes that help
identify the state of the FocusTimer.

![FSM diagram](diagrams/FocusTimerClassDiagram.png)

**Caveats**: For readability, FocusCommand is an abstraction of all the 9 different commands that exist in FocusTimer.

#### State Management

The timer is an inherently complex feature. There are many commands, and some commands
logically cannot be executed in certain states. For example, if the timer is `Paused`,
the user cannot go to the `next` Countdown.

**Problem**: It is confusing to developers to check if the `command` that they are writing

**Solution**: To help developers, we define the expected behaviour for focus timer
in this **simplified** finite state machine (FSM) diagram.

The black circle represents the entrypoint into FocusTimer, and
the labels of the arrows are the valid `command`.
The command `home` has been left out to make the diagram simpler.
It is a command that can be called in any state, and therefore does not add value to it.

![FSM diagram](diagrams/FocusTimerState.png)

From the diagram and the class diagram, we can derive a truth table
from the attributes of each Countdown (e.g. `isReady`) and tag them to a state.

| &or; State / Attribute > | isRunClock | isCompletedCountDown | isReady |  
|--------------------------|------------|----------------------|---------|
| Ready                    | X          | X                    | T       |
| Counting                 | T          | F                    | F       |
| Waiting                  | F          | T                    | F       |
| Paused                   | F          | F                    | F       |

Truth table, where X denotes a 'dont care' condition
where the truth value does not matter.

From this, we can easily check which state we are in and execute/not execute commands as necessary.
Referring to the class diagram, this is implemented on `Session` with 4 methods that help identify the state:

Example implementation to check if Session is in `Counting` state:

```java
public boolean isSessionCounting() {
        Countdown countdown = getCurrentCountdown();
        return countdown.getIsRunning() && !countdown.getIsCompletedCountdown();
}
```

**Easily Identify State**: Developers can hence trivially check if a command is in a valid state to be executed
by using these 4 methods in `Session` to check which state that it is in:
1. `isSessionReady()`  
2. `isSessionCounting()`  
3. `isSessionWaiting()`   
4. `isSessionPaused()`

## Saving data

1. Dealing with missing data files

   Ensure data files are created: Add a new atomic habit using the `add --name Test data file` command in the `hb`
   session<br>
   Quit `WellNUS++`: Issue `home` command in the `hb` session followed by `exit` command in the `main` session<br>
   Delete data files: Delete the `data` folder created in the same folder as the `WellNUS++` jar file you just executed<br>
   Relaunch `WellNUS++`: Run the `WellNUS++` jar file, issue `hb` command and then issue `list` command. Verify that no
   atomic habits are now recorded, i.e. `WellNUS++` should output:<br>

    ```
    
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        You have no habits in your list!
        Start adding some habits by using 'add'!
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    ```

2. Dealing with corrupted data files

   Quit `WellNUS++`<br>
   Open the `data/habit.txt` file located in the same directory as the `WellNUS++` jar file<br>
   Replace the contents of the `habit.txt` file with the following lines:<br>

    ```
    
    --description Valid atomic habit --count 1 --
    --corrupted Data --test to be ignored --
    
    ```

   Run the `WellNUS++` jar file. You should see the warning below after the `WellNUS++` greeting logo and message:<br>

    ```
    
    !!!!!!-------!!!!!--------!!!!!!!------!!!!!---------!!!!!!!
    Error Message:
        Invalid habit data '--corrupted Data --test to be ignored' found in storage!
    Note:
        Previous atomic habit data will not be restored.
    !!!!!!-------!!!!!--------!!!!!!!------!!!!!---------!!!!!!!
    
    ```

   View the saved atomic habits: Issue `hb` followed by `list`. Expected output should be:<br>

    ```
    
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        You have no habits in your list!
        Start adding some habits by using 'add'!
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    ```

   Explanation: Upon relaunch, `WellNUS++` detected the invalid line `--corrupted Data --test to be ignored --`(hence
   the warning message) and cleaned the contents of the data file, leaving no atomic habits recorded
