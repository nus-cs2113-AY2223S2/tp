# Design

## Architecture

![PocketPal Architecture](./static/PocketPalArchitecture.png)

The diagram above illustrates the high-level overview of `PocketPal`.

__Main Components of PocketPal__

- The entry point to our application is `pocketpal.PocketPal`, which creates the `Frontnend` and `Backend` instances at
  launch.
- `PocketPal` also sets up logging for the application, which outputs the logs to `logs/logging.txt`.

__Frontend__
`Frontend` is made up of the following components

- `UI`: Handles display of user interface
- `Parser`: Converts text entered by users into `Command` if valid
- `Command`: Contains the instructions to be executed as input by the user

__Backend__
`Backend` is made up of the following components

- `Endpoint`: The parent component used by various endpoints (`EntryEndpoint` and `EntriesEndpoint`), where the frontend
  can send a `Request`
- `EntryLog`: The main data structure used for temporarily storing multiple `Entry` objects
- `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to the disk, which can be found at `data/storage.txt`

__Communication between `Frontend` and `Backend`__

- PocketPal uses the `Gson` library to serialise and deserialise objects where applicable, such as `Entry`
  and `EntryLog`.
- This allows us to standardise the communication framework between `Frontend` and `Backend`, by using a simplified HTTP
  model.
- Each endpoint takes in a `Request`, and returns a `Response` based on the requested data.

__How the architecture components interact with one another__

The following sequence diagram shows how the main components, `Frontend` and `Backend`, interact with one another.

![PocketPal Sequence Diagram](static/PocketPalSequenceDiagram.png)

Further design details are documented in the [Frontend](#frontend) and [Backend](#backend) sections below.

## Frontend

The API of this component is specified
in [`Frontend.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/pocketpal/frontend/Frontend.java)

![Frontend Sequence Diagram](static/frontend/FrontendSequenceDiagram.png)

- User input and output is handled by `Frontend`
- The application parses the input given by the user in [`Parser`](#parser)
- If parsed successfully, the corresponding `Command` object is executed, which sends a `Request` to the
  appropriate [`Endpoint`](#endpoints) in [`Backend`](#backend) (Refer to `Backend Request Process` sequence diagram)
- If the request is successful, the user is updated through `UI`. Otherwise the error message
  corresponding the user's action is printed instead.

<!-- @@author adenteo -->

### Parser

The `Parser` class is a fundamental component instantiated as soon as PocketPal is initialised. Its __purpose__ is to
convert the user's input into structured data which then produces clear instructions for the rest of the program.

Some of its core features include:

- Breaking down user input and extracting the relevant data for further processing.
- Performing input validation and error handling to ensure that input data is in the correct format and ready to be
  processed.
- Converting the input data into the correct format and returning it as a `Command` class to be further processed by the
  application.

Here's a class diagram that shows only the core structure of the `Parser` class.

![ParserClassDiagram](static/frontend/parser/ParserClassDiagram.png)

How `Parser` works:

1. When a user enters a command, the `Frontend` uses `Parser` to resolve the user input.
2. Parser creates `ParseXYZCommand` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the various command names[^1]
   e.g.`ParseAddCommand()`, `ParseDeleteCommand()`, etc.), which inherits the abstract class `ParseCommand`, to parse
   the input for the corresponding command.
2. Within `ParseXYZCommand`, other methods are called to extract and check the validity of the required parameters for
   that particular command. Any exceptions will be thrown and their corresponding error messages will be shown to the
   user via the `UI` class.
2. If the user input is valid, an `XYZCommand` object containing the relevant data is created and returned.
   E.g. `ParseAddCommand` would return a `AddCommand` object containing the description, price and category.
3. From there, the `XYZCommand` is ready to be executed by the `Backend`. (All `XYZCommand` classes inherit
   from `Command` and
   have corresponding `execute()` that carry out their specific instructions.)

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Parser` component when a user inputs the following
command: `/add -d McDonalds -c Food -p 10.50`

### Commands

#### Add Command

The add entry mechanism is facilitated by `EntryLog`. Every instance of `AddCommand` is created with an `Entry`
instance.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add command work:

![AddCommandSequenceDiagram](static/frontend/commands/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `EntryLog` will be initialized and contains no entry.

Step 2. The user executes `/add Lunch at McDonalds -category Food -price 19.9` command to add an `Entry` to
the `EntryLog`.

_***Note.*** The command will fail its execution if its format is incorrect, and no `Entry` will be added to
the `Entrylog`. An error message will be displayed informing the user._

Step 3. The command will be resolved by `Parser`, which would create an `AddCommmand` object.

Step 4. The `AddCommand` constructor creates and returns an `Entry` object containing the description, price and
category to be added.

Step 5. When `execute()` method is called, a `Request` object is created.

Step 6. From there, the `Request` is ready to be handled. `addEntry()` method is called and the new `Entry` is added to
the `EntryLog`.

Step 7. A success message is after the new `Entry` is added to the `EntryLog`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add command:

![AddCommandActivityDiagram](static/frontend/commands/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Delete Command

The 'delete' entry mechanism is facilitated by `EntryLog`.

Every instance of `DeleteCommand` is created with an Integer, which is the ID of the `Entry` to be deleted.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete command work:

![DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram](static/frontend/commands/DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user decides to remove an `Entry` from the `EntryLog` and executes `/delete 1` command.

_**Note:** The command will fail its execution if the index provided is invalid, and no `Entry` will be removed from
the `EntryLog`. An error message will be displayed informing the user._

Step 2. The command will be resolved by `Parser`, which would create an `DeleteCommmand` object containing the index of
the `Entry` to be deleted.

Step 3. When `execute()` method is called, a `Request` object is created.

Step 4. From there, the `Request` is ready to be handled. `deleteEntry()` method is called and the `Entry` is removed
from `EntryLog`.

Step 5. A success message is displayed after the `Entry` is removed from `EntryLog`.


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delete command:

![DeleteCommandActivityDiagram](static/frontend/commands/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Edit Command

##### Overall class diagram for editing an Entry

![EditCommandClassDiagram](static/frontend/commands/EditCommandClassDiagram.png)

##### Implementation

**Step 1.** User runs Edit command, specifying the ID of the entry to edit, as well as the new attributes of the
respective
fields.

**Step 2.** Parser extracts the relevant argument and returns a EditCommand object.

**Step 3.** The execute method of the EditCommand is called and a Request object is created. This request object
specifies
the modifications of the various fields.

**Step 4.** The Request object is then parsed as an argument to the Backend Class, which feeds this request as an
argument
to a method in the EntryEndpoint class.

**Step 5.** The EntryEndpoint class then finds and modifies the entry as specified by the user.

**Step 6.** Upon successful completion of the modification, the EntryEndpoint class returns a Response object to the
Backend class. The Response object contains the updated fields of the entry.

However, if the edit operation fails, the response object will contain the relevant exception message which would be
printed to the user.

**Step 7.** The Backend class calls the save() method to update the Storage class with the edited entry.It then returns
the Response object to the execute function in the EditCommand object.

**Step 8.** The printExpenditureEdited method under the UI class is then called in the execute function and an
acknowledgement message is printed to the user.

##### Overall sequence diagram for editing an Entry

![img_1.png](static/frontend/commands/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### View Command

##### Class diagram of view command

![ViewCommandClassDiagram.png](./static/frontend/commands/ViewCommandClassDiagram.png)
Class diagram above shows the methods called in the execute method of the
View Command object.

##### Implementation

![ViewCommandSequenceDiagram.png](static/frontend/commands/ViewCommandOverallSequenceDiagram.png)

More elaboration about the reference frame [Endpoint /entries - Handle GET] can be found 
[here](#Get-recent-or-all-entries).

**Step 1.** String of user arguments is fed into the parseViewCommand method in Parser object.

**Step 2.** The various filters such as price and dateTime are extracted from the argument String and fed into the
constructor of viewCommand.

**Step 3.** A request object is instantiated, with all the query parameters (eg price) as its attributes.

**Step 4.** The request is fed into the backend method requestEndpointEntries, which then sends this request to the
EntriesEndpoint class.

**Step 5.** A response object is then returned from EntriesEndpoint. This response contains the serialised form of all
relevant entries.

**Step 6.** The entries are then deserialised and fed into the ui printEntriesToBeViewed method, which prints the
details of each entry to the user.

#### Help Command

The 'help' mechanism is facilitated by `HelpCommand`. It extends the abstract `Command` with an overriden `execute()` 
method.

The following sequence diagram shows hows the help command work:

![HelpCommandSequenceDiagram](static/frontend/commands/HelpCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example scenario and how the help mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user decides to view the help guide for add function, and executes `/help add`.

_**Note:** The command will fail its execution if the command type provided behind `help` is invalid. An error message 
will be displayed informing the user._ 

Step 2. The command will be resolved by `Parser`, which instantiates a `HelpCommand` object using the appropriate
constructor.

Step 3. When execute() method is called, printHelpAdd() method is called from the `UI`. This method prints out 
instructions on how the `add` command should be used.

#### Exit/Bye Command

##### Implementation

**Step 1.** The Parser extracts the bye command from the user input and calls the parseHelpCommand method.

**Step 2.** An ExitCommand is returned and since this command is the only command object with the isExit attribute set
as "true", the while loop of the program will terminate since !isExit is the loop condition.

## Backend

The API of this component is specified
in [`Backend.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/pocketpal/backend/Backend.java)

The backend uses a simplified RESTful API approach. This allows us to decouple code using the proven industry practices.
The following diagram illustrates the relationship between various classes involved in `Backend` as described in
the [application architecture](#architecture).

![Backend](./static/backend/BackendClassDiagram.png)

On startup, `Backend` creates various `Endpoint` instances, which can be illustrated by the following diagram:
<img src="static/backend/BackendStartupSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Backend Startup Sequence Diagram" />

Making a request

When `Backend` receives a `Request` from `Frontend`, the receiving `Endpoint` will process it based on the request
method and parameters, which can be accessed using `Request::getParam()`. The request will be processed based on its
method. There are currently 4 methods supported: `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`.

### Storage

The `Storage` class is responsible for the serialization of `Entry` data into a csv-like syntax, as well as the
deserialization of that data back into `Entry` objects.

The main callable functions to be used are:

- `readFromDatabase()` - Deserializes data stored in text form back into `Entry` objects. Executed when PocketPal is
  instantiated
- `writeToDatabase()` - Serializes `Entry` objects in `EntryLog` into text form.
- `reset()` - Clears whatever is in the stored text file, without affecting what is in the current `EntryLog`.

<!-- The structure of the Storage class is as follows:

![StorageClassDiagram](static/backend/storage/StorageClassDiagram.png) -->

#### Reading from Database

The `readFromDatabase()` method is called from a `Backend` instance upon its instantiation, and reads from the database
which comes in the form of a text file.

![StorageReadSequenceDiagram](static/backend/storage/StorageSequenceDiagramRead.png)

1. When a `Backend` instance is created, the constructor will call the `readFromDatabase()` method which first
   calls `makeFileIfNotExists()` to create a new database file if it does not exist.
2. The `readEntryLine()` method reads the data from the database file line by line, until there are no more lines to
   read. It then returns a list of `Entry` objects which is passed back to the `Backend` instance to be processed.
3. Two possible exceptions to be thrown are the `IOException` and the `InvalidReadFile` exceptions.

#### Writing to Database

The `writeFromDatabase()` method is called from a `Backend` instance through the `save()` method.

![StorageWriteSequenceDiagram](static/backend/storage/StorageSequenceDiagramWrite.png)

1. The `save()` method calls the `writeFromDatabase()` method which first calls `makeFileIfNotExists()` to create a new
   database file if it does not exist.
2. The `writeEntryLine()` method writes the data into the database file line by line, until there are no more lines to
   write. If successful, nothing is returned.
3. An `IOException` might be thrown in this method.

#### Resetting Database

The `reset()` method is called from a `Backend` instance through the `clearData()` method.

![StorageWriteSequenceDiagram](static/backend/storage/StorageSequenceDiagramReset.png)

1. The `clearData()` method calls the `reset()` method which first deletes the database file, then calls
   the `makeFileIfNotExists()` method to create a new database file. If successful, nothing is returned.
2. An `IOException` might be thrown in this method.

### API

#### Endpoints

![Endpoints](static/backend/endpoint/EndpointClassDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram for specific request handling at each endpoint can be viewed at their respective sections.

Each endpoint is a child class `Endpoint`. Currently, there are 2 endpoints available:

| Endpoint   | Method to call             |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| `/entry`   | `requestEntryEndpoint()`   |
| `/entries` | `requestEntriesEndpoint()` |

##### Creating a request

- To create a request, simply instantiate `pocketpal.communication.pocketpal.Request`
  with the desired request method.
- If there are any parameters associated with the request, you may add them using `addParam()`

```java
Request req=new Request(RequestMethod.PATCH);
        req.addParam(RequestParams.EDIT_DESCRIPTION,"mango juice");
```

##### Making a request

- To call each endpoint, pass the `Request` into its corresponding method in the frontend.
- A `Response` will be returned to the frontend.

> All request body and parameter data should be serialised with `String.valueOf()` if not specified.

```java
Backend backend=new Backend();
        Response res=backend.callEntryEndpoint(req);

        if(res.getResponseStatus()!=ResponseStatus.OK){
        // handle status        
        }

        Entry entry=EntryParser.deserialise(res.getData());
// process entry
```

We recommend using Gradle to run tests and coding style checks using `./gradlew clean check`

## Types of Tests

1. Unit testing which targets lower level units, such as `pocketpal.data.*`, `pocketpal.communication.*`.
2. Integration testing is performed in classes which use multiple units, such as `pocketpal.backend.*Endpoint`, `pocketpal.frontend.*Command`, with the assumption that the base units are working.

## Unit Test Strategy

We adopt the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern for unit tests in this project.
This allows us to achieve a structured unit tests while balancing code readability and maintainability, and allowing a
clear separation of the setup, operations and results.
For backend testing, we use utility classes such as `EntryTestUtil` and `BackendTestUtil` to reduce code repetition and
to simplify the testing process.

<details markdown=1>
<summary markdown="span">Example</summary>

  ```java

@DisplayName("Test /entries [GET]")
class TestEntriesGet extends EntryTestUtil {
    private static final EntryLog expectedEntryLog = new EntryLog();

    @BeforeEach
    void init() {
        TEST_BACKEND.clearData();
        expectedEntryLog.clearAllEntries();
    }

    @Test
    void entriesEndpointGET_recentEntries_correctEntries() {
        // Arrange
        addEntry(ENTRY_1);
        addEntry(ENTRY_2);
        addEntry(ENTRY_3);
        addEntry(ENTRY_4);
        expectedEntryLog.addEntry(ENTRY_3);
        expectedEntryLog.addEntry(ENTRY_4);

        // Act
        Request request = new Request(RequestMethod.GET); // recent 2 entries
        request.addParam(RequestParams.NUM_ENTRIES, "2");
        Response response = TEST_BACKEND.requestEndpointEntries(request);
        EntryLog returnedEntryLog = EntryLogParser.deserialise(response.getData());

        // Assert
        assertEquals(response.getResponseStatus(), ResponseStatus.OK);
        assertTrue(isSameEntryLog(expectedEntryLog, returnedEntryLog));
    }
}
  ```

# Appendix F: Testing with sample data (from file)

PocketPal stores data in a *storage.txt* file under the "*data/*" directory. Each row in the "*storage.txt*" file
represents a single Entry. Each column in each row should have 3 columns, representing the *description* of the
Entry, *amount* associated with the Entry and *category* of the Entry in that order, and are separated with the ","
delimiter. All of them are in the String format.

An example *storage.txt* file that will be readable by PocketPal is as such:

```
Apple Juice,5.50,Food
Bus Card,50,Transportation
Paracetamol,10.39,Medical
```

which will give us 3 Entries.

As of the time of writing, the available categories are:

- Clothing
- Entertainment
- Food
- Medical
- Others
- Personal
- Transportation
- Utilities
- Income

An empty input for category is not allowed. If necessary, use the "Others" category.

## Exceptions

Exceptions are thrown for a couple of cases where files are being read. If you wish to test the exceptions, they can be
replicated as follows:

1. Delimiter is invalid: If the delimiter is not the comma (","), it is not recognised as a delimiter and will not be
   processed correctly.
   > Example row: Apple Juice|5.50|Food - In this case, the pipe ("|") is used as a delimiter, which is not allowed.
2. Amount is invalid: If the amount is not a numeric, it is not recognised as a valid amount and will not be processed
   correctly.
   > Example row: Apple Juice,5A6B,Food - In this case, the amount is "5A6B", which is not a numeric and therefore not
   > allowed.
3. Category is invalid: If the category is not a string from the list of allowed categories (see above), it is not
   recognised as a valid category and will not be processed correctly.
   > Example row: Apple Juice,5.50,Drink - In this case, the category is "Drink", which is not a valid category and
   > therefore not allowed.
4. Not enough columns: If a row has insufficient columns compared to what is needed, the Entry cannot be created.
   > Example row: Apple Juice,5.50 - In this case, there are only two categories which is not allowed.
