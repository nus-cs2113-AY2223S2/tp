### Architecture

The following diagram describes the architecture of Inka:
![Architecture Diagram](img/Architecture.svg)

- Red arrows show the path taken to parse user input
- Blue arrows show possible side-effects of executing the command

### UI Component

API: `UserInterface.java`

The `UserInterface` is a simple class that handles interactions with the user, such as getting input to be passed to the
parser, or formatting output (e.g., custom messages and conversion of custom objects like `CardList` to string
representations).

### Parser Component

API: `Parser.java`

Inka's parser has a hierarchical design built on top of Apache Commons CLI which allows for parsing of flags in any
order. Modularity also allows for new commands to be easily added.

![Parser Class](img/ParserClass.svg)

The user's command is interpreted with the following structure:

```
<keyword> <action> [flag(s)]
```

For example, a command such as `card add -q QN -a ANS` would be broken down as:

- Keyword: `card`
- Action: `add`
- Flags
    - `-q`: Question text
    - `-a`: Answer text

When the user's input is passed to `Parser`:

1. User input is split into a series of _tokens_
2. `Parser` looks at the keyword token and dispatches the appropriate `KeywordParser`
3. `KeywordParser` looks at the action token and calls `OptionBuilder` to create an `Options` object for the flags it
   expects
4. Apache Commons CLI Parser is called with `Options`
5. The Apache Parser returns the arguments of the flags
6. The respective `Command` is constructed and returned through the parser chain
7. The `Command` is executed to modify state (`CardList`, `TagList` and `DeckList`), and may interact with
   the `UserInterface` and `Storage` objects to print output or save the program state respectively.

The following is the sequence diagram for parsing `card add -q QN -a ANS`:

![Parser Sequence Diagram](img/ParserSequence.svg)

### Selector Component

API: `CardSelector.java`, `TagSelector.java`

Complimentary to the parser design is the use of _selectors_ to allow the user more flexibility in how they choose to
specify a `Card` or a `Tag`.

- Aim: Allow the user to refer to a `Card` either by its `CardUUID` or its index in `card list`, and to refer to a `Tag`
  either by its name or its index in `tag list`
- Difficulties:
    - By design, the parsers should not require access to `CardList` or `TagList` to decouple the user input parsing and
      the actual application logic
    - The parsed `Command` should only fetch the corresponding `Card`/`Tag` once `Command::execute()` is run, hence
      requiring an intermediate representation

By encapsulating the identifier in a selector class, retrieving the actual instance of `Card`/`Tag`
from `CardList`/`TagList` can be deferred until `Command::execute()` is run.

The class diagram for the selector-style classes are as follows:

![Selector Class Diagram](img/SelectorClass.svg)

### Storage Component

API: `Storage.java`

Inka's storage functions operate in the `JsonStorage` class that extends the `Storage` class, that implements
the `IDataStorage` interface.
The methods `load()` and `save()` read and write to the filesystem respectively.
This also serves to implement the [export feature](#export-feature) .
It uses a `Memory` object as an intermediary to contain app data during serialization and deserialization.
It uses methods contained within the classes `JsonToMemory` and `MemoryToJson` to deserialize and serialize app save
data respectively.

The class diagram is as seen below:

![Storage Class Diagram](img/NewStorageClassDiagram.PNG)

### CardList Component

API: `CardList.java`

Inka's Cards are stored inside `CardList` Component. Each Card has a reference to its own randomly generated `uuid` as
well as a reference to `tags` and `decks`, which are essentially the UUIDs of the tags and decks that each card is
associated with.
`uuid` and `tags` and `decks` are stored in the form of `CardUUID`, `TagUUID` and `DeckUUID` class and all of them
inherit from the `InkaUUID` class.

The following describes the class diagram for CardList Component :

![CardList Class Diagram](img/CardListClass.png)

### TagList Component

API: `TagList.java`

Inka's TagList Component stores a list of `Tag` as tags. Each `Tag` contains its own uuid, which is auto generated in
the constructor of `Tag`, as well as the cards and decks that it
is associated with in the form of `CardUUID` and `DeckUUID`. All `CardUUID`, `TagUUID`, and `DeckUUID` inherit
from `InkaUUID` as they all
share the same methods and implementations.

The following describes the class diagram for TagList Component :
![TagList Class Diagram](img/TagListClass.png)

### DeckList Component

API: `DeckList.java`

Inka's DeckList Component stores a list fo `Deck` as decks. Each `Deck` contains its own `UUID`, which is auto generated
in the constructor of `Deck` as well as the tags and cards that is associated with, which are stored in the form of
`CardUUID`, `TagUUID`. As mentioned previously, `CardUUID`, `TagUUID` and `DeckUUID` inherit from `InkaUUID`.

The following describes the class diagram for the DeckList Component :

![DeckList_Class_Diagram](img/DeckListFinal.svg)

## Implementation

- [card feature](#card-feature)
- [tag feature](#tag-feature)
- [export feature](#export-feature)
- [deck feature](#deck-feature)

### Card Feature

The current functionalities:

- add a new Card (questions and answers) to the cardlist
- delete card from the cardlist
- show all cards the cardlist contains
- view the card by its uuid

#### Card Add

User input format for adding a card

```
card add -q QN -a ANS
```

For adding a card, a sample user input like `card add -q QN -a ANS` would be broken down as:

- Keyword: `card`
- Action: `add`
- Flags
    - `-q`: Question text
    - `-a`: Answer text

The implementation of `card add -q QN -a ANS` will be shown below :

1. When the user enters `card add -q QN -a ANS`, the input is passed to `Parser` class which
   calls `Parser::parseCommand()`. The parser detects the keyword "card", then calls the `Parser::CardKeywordParser()`
   on the user inputs excluding the "card" keyword.


2. The `Parser::CardKeywordParser()` further extracts the action keyword "add" from the user input, and calls
   the `CardKeywordParser::handleAdd()` method.


3. The method uses the Apache Commons CLI library to parse the remaining user input to create a `Card` object with the
   arguements of the flags "-q" and "-a" in the input as its question and answer, and returns an `AddCardCommand` with
   the created `Card` object. The sequence diagram for the first 3 steps has been shown in
   the [parser sequence diagram](#parser-component).


4. This `AddCardCommand` will call the `CardList::addCard()` function and add the created `Card` object to
   the `CardList`.


5. Lastly, `UserInterface` will print a success message and the current number of `Card` objects in the `CardList` with
   the corresponding functions.

The sequence diagram below shows how this feature of card works:
![Card Add feature](img/CardAddSequence.svg)

#### Card Delete

User input format for deleting a card

```
card delete [-i CARDINDEX | -c CARDUUID]
```

A sample user input, like `card delete -i 3` would be broken down as:

- Keyword: `card`
- Action: `delete`
- Flag
    - `-i`: Index of card to be deleted

The implementation of `card delete -i 3` will be shown below :

1. When the user enters `card delete [-i CARDINDEX | -c CARDUUID]`, the input is passed to `Parser` class which
   calls `Parser::parseCommand()`. The parser detects the keyword "card", then calls the `Parser::CardKeywordParser()`
   on the user inputs excluding the "card" keyword.

2. The `Parser::CardKeywordParser()` further extracts the action keyword "delete" from the user input and
   call `CardKeywordParser::handleDelete()` method.

3. The method uses the Apache Commons CLI library to parse the remaining user input, and returns a `DeleteCardCommand`
   with a `CardSelector` argument. The `CardSelector` object has two optional fields, an int field or an uuid field,
   used in identifying the `Card` object, in this case to be deleted. The sequence diagram for the first 3 steps has
   been shown in the [parser sequence diagram](#parser-component).

4. The `DeleteCardCommand` will first find the `Card` object to delete, then find all the `Tag` and `Deck` objects it is
   associated to by their uuids stored in the `Card` object, and delete the `Card` object's uuid from them.

5. Then the `Card` object is deleted from the `CardList`.

6. Lastly, `UserInterface` will print a success message and the current number of `Card` objects in the `CardList` with
   the corresponding functions.

The sequence diagram below shows how this feature of card works:
![Card Delete feature](img/CardDeleteSequence.svg)

#### Card List

User input format for listing all card

```
card list
```

A sample user input, like `card list` would be broken down as :

- Keyword: `card`
- Action: `list`

The implementation of `card list` will be shown below :

1. When the user enters `card list`, the input is passed to `Parser` class which calls `Parser::parseCommand()`. The
   parser detects the keyword "card", then calls the `Parser::CardKeywordParser()` on the user inputs excluding the "
   card" keyword.
2. The `Parser::CardKeywordParser()` further extracts the action keyword "list" from the user input and
   call `CardKeywordParser::handleList()` method.
3. If there are no more user input after `card list`, a `ListCardCommand()` is returned. The sequence diagram for the
   first 3 steps has been shown in the [parser sequence diagram](#parser-component).
4. The command will call `UserInterface::printCardList()` method to print all `Card` objects in the `CardList`.

The sequence diagram below shows how this feature of card works:

![Card List feature](img/CardListSequence.svg)

#### Card View

The implementation of `card view {-c CARD_UUID | -i CARD_INDEX}` will be shown below :

- When the user enters `card view {-c CARD_UUID | -i CARD_INDEX}`, the input is processed by `Parser` which eventually
  returns a `ViewCardCommand`. The sequence diagram for this section has been shown [above](#parser-component).


- This `ViewCardCommand::execute()` will first find the card that is to be viewed by calling
  the `CardList::findCard()` which will in turn call the `CardSelector::getIndex()`
  and `CardSelector::getUUID()` depending on the flags and parameter specified by the user. `CardSelector` will then
  return the `cardToView` to `CardList` and then
  to `ViewCardCommand`.


- If the `cardToView` is not null, it will be passed to `UserInterface::printCard()` to be printed. `ViewCardCommand`
  will proceed to call `Card::getTagsUUID()` which will
  return `tagsUUID` and `Card::getDecksUUID()` which will return `decksUUID`.


- Once the `tagsUUID` is ready, `ViewCardCommand` will then call  `ViewCardCommand::findTagFromTagUUID` which will loop
  through each element `Tag` of `TagList`, call `Tag::getUUID()` and match it with every element of the `tagsUUID`
  previously. If the `Tag` element's uuid matches the uuid in `tagsUUID`, then the `Tag` will be added to a `tagsFound`
  and returned to `ViewCardCommand`(this part is shown in a separate reference frame).


- Similarly, once the `decksUUID` is ready, `ViewCardCommand` will then call  `ViewCardCommand::findDeckFromDeckUUID`
  which will loop through each element `Deck` of `DeckList`, call `Deck::getUUID()` and match it with every element of
  the `decksUUID` previously. If the `Deck` element's uuid matches the uuid in `decksUUID`, then the `Deck` will be
  added to a `decksFound` and returned to `ViewCardCommand`.
  (this part is also shown in a separate reference frame).

The sequence diagram below shows how this feature works:
![Card View feature](img/CardViewSequence.png)

Reference Frames :

![Add Decks to decksFound](img/AddDecksToDecksFoundRef.png)

### Tag Feature

Tag Feature currently supports the following functionalities :

- add a tag to a card
- delete a tag from the tagList and all the associated cards
- list all the existing tags in the tagList
- list all the cards under a tag
- edit the tag name

This guide will show two of the more complex implementation of the tag features, other tag-related features will be
similar :

#### Untag a Card

The implementation of the `card untag` feature is as follows:

- When the user enters `card untag {-c CARD_UUID} | -i CARD_INDEX} {-t TAG_NAME | -x TAG_INDEX}`, the input is processed
  by `Parser` which eventually returns a `RemoveTagFromCardCommand`. The sequence diagram for this section has been
  shown [above](#parser-component).


- This `RemoveTagFromCardCommand::execute()` will first find the card to remove the tag from by calling
  the `CardList::findCard()` which will in turn call the `CardSelector::getIndex()`
  and `CardSelector::getUUID()` depending on the flags and parameter specified by the user. `CardSelector` will then
  return the `cardAffected` to `CardList` and then back
  to `RemoveTagFromCardCommand`.


- `RemoveTagFromCardCommand` will then find the tag to delete from the card by calling `TagList::findCard(cardSelector)`
  which will in turn call the`TagSelector::getIndex()` and `TagSelector::getTagName()`  depending on the flags and
  parameter specified by the user. `TagSelector` will return the `tagToRemove` to `TagList` and then back
  to `RemoveTagFromCardCommand`.


- After `cardAffected` and `tagToRemove` is ready, `RemoveCardFromTagCommand` will
  call `RemoveTagFromCardCommand::removeTagFromCard(cardAffected, tagToRemove)` which will check if the `Tag` is
  currently inside a deck, if it is, we will loop through all the decks that the `Tag` is currently inside and remove
  the `cardAffected` from each of the deck (this part is shown in a separate reference frame)


- Afterwards, `RemoveTagFromCardCommand::removeTagFromCard(cardAffected, tagToRemove)`  will remove the reference
  to the tag from the card and remove the reference to the card from the tag by
  calling `Card::getUUID()`, `Tag::removeCard()`, `Tag::getUUID()`,`Card::RemoveTag()` (this part is also shown in a
  separate reference frame.


- Finally, `RemoveTagFromCardCommand` will then call `UserInterface::printRemoveTagFromCard()` to print successful
  removal of `tagToRemove` from `cardAffected`.

The sequence diagram below shows how this feature works:
![Card Untag](img/CardUntagSequence.png)

Reference Frames :

![Remove affected Cards from Decks](img/RemoveCardFromDecksRef.png)

![Remove Tag from Card and vice versa](img/RemoveTagFromCardRef.png)

#### List Cards under a Tag

The implementation of the `tag list {-t TAG_NAME | -x TAG_INDEX}`

- When the user enters `tag list {-t TAG_NAME | -x TAG_INDEX}`, the input is processed by `Parser` which eventually
  returns a `ListCardsUnderTagCommand`. The sequence diagram for this section has been shown [above](#parser-component).


- This `ListCardsUnderTagCommand::execute()` will find the tag under which to display the cards from by calling
  the `TagList::findTag()` which will in turn call the `TagSelector::getIndex()`
  and `TagSelector::getTagName()` depending on the flags and parameter specified by the user. `TagSelector` will then
  return the `foundTag` to `TagList` and then back to `ListCardsUnderTagCommand`.


- After `foundTag`  is ready, `ListCardsUnderTagCommand` will
  call `ListCardsUnderTagCommand::findCardsUnderTag(foundTag)` which will call the `Tag::getCardsUUID` and return the
  UUIDs of the cards under the `Tag` in the form of `cardsUUID`.


- `ListCardsUnderTagCommand` will then loop through the entire cardList and the `cardsUUID`, if their uuid matches,
  that `Card` will be added to `foundCardList` and returned to `ListCardsUnderTagCommand` (this part is shown in a
  separate reference frame).


- Once `foundCardList` is returned, `ListCardsUnderTagCommand` will call `UserInterface::printCardList(foundCardList)`
  to print the list of cards under the specified tag.

The sequence diagram below shows how this feature works:
![List Cards under Tag](img/ListCardsUnderTagSequence.png)

Reference Frames :

![Add Cards to foundCardList](img/AddCardsToFoundCardListRef.png)

### Export Feature

The implementation of the Export feature is split into [saving](#save) and [loading](#load)

### Save

Saving is implemented with `save()`

If the user the command `export` or exiting the app with `bye`, the app will save their data to both a
file, `savedata.json` and a backup file, `backup.json`. It does so by calling save() on both the file and the backup
file.

1. All data is compiled into a `Memory` object.
2. Memory is serialized into a Json Format using the method `convert()` in `MemoryToJson` that returns a `JsonObject`.
3. The Json is written into the filesystem.

The sequence diagram below illustrates this feature:

![export feature](img/SaveSequenceDiagram.PNG)


### Load

Loading is implemented with `load()`

`load()` is called by inka on app startup to read a file `savedata.json` in the directory of the jar file. If the file
is corrupted, `load()` is called to read a file `backup.json` instead.

1. The file is read and parsed as a Json using `Gsonbuilder`, being converted into a `JsonObject`.
2. The `JsonObject` is deserialized into a `Memory` object using the `convert()` method in `JsonToMemory`.
3. The memory object is returned to be read from by Inka.

The sequence diagram below illustrates this feature:

![export feature](img/LoadSequenceDiagram.PNG)



### Deck Feature

The Deck Feature currently supports the following functionalities :

- add a `Card` to a `Deck`
- add a `Tag` to a `Deck`
- delete a `Deck` from the `DeckList`
- delete a `Card` from a `Deck`
- delete a `Tag` from a `Deck`
- list all the `Deck` in the `DeckList`
- list all the `Card` under a `Deck`
- list all the `Tag` under a `Deck`
- let the user cycle through all the `Card` in the `Deck`
- rename the `Deck`

This guide will show two of the more complex implementation of the tag features, other tag-related features will be
similar :

#### Add Card to the Deck

This is the implementation of adding a card to the deck in the following format
`card deck {-i CARD_INDEX | -c CARD_UUID } -d {DECK_NAME}`. This command adds the card to a certain deck, if the
deck already exists, if it doesn't. then a new deck is created and the card is added to it. The points below roughly
elucidate what happens internally when this command is run:

- When a user enters the command above, the input is passed on to the `Parser` class, which calls its method
  `Parser::parseCommand()`.


- Upon detecting the `card` keyword, the input is passed to the
  `CardKeywordParser::parseTokens()` method.


- Based on this, the method returns a call to the method
  `CardKeywordParser::handleAction()` which eventually leads to the `CardKeywordParser::handleDeck()` method due to the
  presence of the keyword `deck` in the input.


- This method returns the constructor
  `AddCardToDeckCommand::AddCardToDeckCommand(deckName, cardSelector)`.


- This leads to the triggering of the `AddCardToDeckCommand::execute()` method, which then internally calls the
  `AddCardToDeckCommand::addCardToDeck()`, only after the card which needs to be added to the deck is identified by the
  `CardList::findCard(cardSelector)` method.


- Next, the deck to which the card must be added is identified by using the `DeckList::findDeckFromName(deckName)`. The
  `cardUUID` of the card which needs to be added to the deck is obtained via `Card::getUuid()`.


- Subsequently, we then check to see if the deck to which the card must be added to is null or not. If it null it means
  that the deck was never initialized to begin with. In order to initialize it, we first print a message tp the user
  using `UserInterface::printDeckCreationSuccess()`, followed by new `Deck` object creation using its constructor
  `Deck::deck(deckName, cardToAddUUID)`. Next, the card is added to the `HashSet` of the `Deck` object using
  `Deck::addCardToSet(cardToAddUUID)` and the `Deck` object is added to the `deckList` by `DeckList::addDeck()`.


- If the deck to which the card must be added is not null, then we simply add the card to the `Deck` object's
  `HashSet` and `ArrayList`. **The `HashSet` is an aggregation of all the cards in the `Deck` object, whereas the
  `ArrayList` only contains `CardUUID` which were added separately to the `Deck`**.


- Lastly, the `DeckUUID` is added to the `Card` object as well, this is to enable better deletion and adding
  algorithms.

The sequence diagram is as such:

![Add Cards to Deck](img/AddCardToDeck.png)

Here is the reference frame that has been extracted

![Add Cards to Deck](img/AddCardToDeckRef.PNG)


#### List Cards and Tags under a Deck

This is the implementation of `deck list -d {DECK_NAME}`. The command lists the individual cards and tags under
the `Deck` object.

- When a user enters the command above, the input is passed on to the `Parser` class, which calls its method
  `Parser::parseCommand()`.


- Upon detecting the `deck` keyword, the input is passed to the
  `DeckKeywordParser::parseTokens()` method.


- Based on this, the method returns a call to the method
  `DeckKeywordParser::handleAction()` which eventually leads to the `DeckKeywordParser::handleList` method due to the
  presence of the keyword `list` in the input.


- This method returns the constructor
  `ListItemsDeckCommand::ListItemsDeckCommand()` due to the presence of the `-d` flag.


- Now, the `ListItemsDeckCommand::execute()` triggers the execution of the `ListItemsDeckCommand::
  findCardsUnderDeck(cardList, deckList)`.


- The sole purpose of this method is to gather a `CardList` of all cards that
  are under the `Deck` **directly**, this does not include the cards which are under the deck via tags.


- In order to
  accomplish this, the method uses `DeckList::findDeckFromName(deckName)` to obtain the revelant deck and
  `Deck::getCardsUUID` to obtain an `ArrayList` of the `CardUUIDs` under the deck. Next, a perusal of the `CardList` is
  done in order to match the `CardUUId` with the relevant `Card`, if matches are found, they are added to the
  `foundCardList`.


- Next, the list of cards is printed using the `UserInterface::printCardList(foundCardList)`.

A similar process is done to obtain the `TagList` containing the list of tags under the deck and is printed, it can be
observed in the sequence diagram below:

![List Items under a Deck](img/ListItemDeckFinal.png)

The reference frames provided are very similar to the ones provided above in the
[UnTag Cards section](#list-cards-under-a-tag)
