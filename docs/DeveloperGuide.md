## Acknowledgements

We first give acknowledgement to Module Coordinator, Dr Akshay Narayan, and Teaching Assistant, Aditi Chadha for guidance and supervision over the ChChing project. <br>
We utilized the [tp project](https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2223S2/tp) of the nus-cs2113-AY2223S2 organisation as our template for ChChing.
<br>The [addressbook-level2](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2) & [addressbook-level3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) project by SE-EDU largely inspired the format and coding style of ChChing.

### ExchangeRateApi

The `LiveCurrencyApi` class uses the [ExchangeRateApi](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) to retrieve the latest exchange rates.


## Design & implementation

Below are the design and implementations of key features of the ChChing program.
<br> We used various diagrams such as architectural diagram, UML class diagrams, sequence diagrams and activity diagrams
to illustrate our methodology and approach.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Design
The architectural diagram of ChChing below provides an overview of the design of our program.

![Design](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ChChing program first enters the `run()` state, where it will access the `Storage` class
which reads the .json file from `Data` to populate the program's entries.

Next, `User` inputs are read by `Ui`, which passes the inputs to `run()`. `run()` sends the
inputs to `Parser` which is responsible for returning a recognized `Command`.

Next, `run()` calls for the specific `Command` class to be executed.

`Command` makes use of `Ui` to present the appropriate command output to the user.
When the program is to exit, `Command` instructs `Storage` to write the entries to `Data`.

`Storage` will read from `Data` when the program is launched and write and update to `Data`
when the program exits.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Implementation

### Record and RecordList

The main class in our program is the `Record` and `RecordList` abstract classes, in which `Income`, `Expense` will inherit from `Record` and `IncomeList` and `ExpenseList` will inherit from `RecordList`. Most commands will act on instances of the `Income`, `Expense`,`IncomeList` and `ExpenseList` classes.

![Record Class](images/Record_RecordList_UML_class.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### DeleteIncomeCommand

The proposed DeleteIncomeCommand mechanism is facilitated by `System`, `Incomes`, `UI` and `ChChingException`.  
The command receives the instruction from `UI` and will call the `execute` method.  
If `index <= 0`, the command will throw a new ChChingException and print `"Zero/Negative index"`.  
If `index > incomes.size()`, the command will also throw a new ChChingException and print `"The number is too big"`  
Entering any of these optional lines will result in early termination of the command.  
Or else, the command will continue to delete the entry at the particular index.  
Afterwards, the `execute()` method will print `"Income deleted, here is the updated list:"` and prints the entries in the income list.

### Target and TargetStorage

The `Target` and `TargetStorage` class allows users to set a target for their ideal balance.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### EditIncomeCommand/EditExpenseCommand

The proposed edit income command is facilitated by `Parser`, `EditIncomeCommand`, `IncomeList`, while the proposed edit expense command is facilitated by `Parser`, `EditExpenseCommand` and `ExpenseList`.

Note that below highlights the implementation of the edit income command, with edit expense command following the same implementation.

Given below is how the edit income mechanism works at each step:

1. The user types in the command for edit income with the necessary arguments given to indicate which income record to edit and what fields to edit for the chosen income record.
2. The line inputted by the user will then be parsed by `Parser`, where it will check if the input contains a valid index with valid fields to edit. If they are valid, it will return `EditIncomeCommand`. Else it will throw a `ChChingException` indicating an error in the input from the user.
3. `EditIncomeCommand` will then perform its `execute` method, where for each field to be edited, it will call `editIncome` method from the `ExpenseList` class. This would then update the required income record accordingly.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit income command works:
<br> ![edit income sequence diagram](images/EditIncomeCommand_sequence_diagram.png)

The edit expense command works in a similar way, with an additional hasCategory check in its sequence diagram as shown:
<br> ![edit expense sequence diagram](images/EditExpenseCommand_sequence_diagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes edit income command:
<br> ![edit income activity diagram](images/EditIncomeCommand_activity_diagram.png)
<br> Note: edit expense command produces the same activity diagram.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Design Considerations**
<br>The following are the design alternatives we considered for edit income/expense command:

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Edit only the specific fields indicated in the input arguments.
  - Pros: Easier for the user to input an edit.
  - Cons: May introduce more bugs.
- **Alternative 2:** Edit to require user to rewrite all its fields.
  - Pros: Easier to implement.
  - Cons: Not any easier than having the user to just delete and add new expense/income.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### AddIncomeCommand

The AddIncomeCommand is facilitated by `Parser`, `AddIncomeCommand`, `IncomeList` and `Ui`.

1. The user inputs the command to add income. This input is handled by `parser` which if successful, returns the `AddIncomeCommand`.
2. `AddIncomeCommand` will call its `execute` method
   which calls the `IncomeList` method `addIncome` to add the input into `incomes`.
3. `execute` then calls the `Ui` method `showAdded` which makes use of `System`
   to print the `Income` added.

![AddIncomeCommand](images/AddIncomeCommand_Sequence_Diagram.png)
<br> Note: AddExpenseCommand works in a similar way.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### ListExpenseCommand

The listExpenseCommand is facilitated by `Parser`, `ListExpenseCommand` and `ExpenseList`.

1. The user inputs the command to list expense. This input is handled by`Parser` which returns the
   `listExpenseCommand` if successful.
2. `ListExpenseCommand` will then call its `execute` method
   which makes use of `System` to print a new line `"Expenses:"`.
3. The `ExpenseList` method `printExpenseList`
   is called, which iterates through the expenseList, `expenses` and prints the index as well as a completed string of
   expenses in `expenses`.

![ListExpenseCommand](images/ListExpenseCommand_Sequence_Diagram.png)
<br> Note: ListIncomeCommand works in a similar way, but instead calls `printIncomeList`.
<br> Note: ListCommand works in a similar way, but calls both `printIncomeList` and `printExpenseList`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### SetTargetCommand

The setTargetCommand is facilitated by `ChChing`, `Parser`, `TargetParser`, `TargetStorage`.
When the command receives to set target, the `parse()` method of the `Parser` object will read in the command and call the `parseTarget()` method from the TargetParser class
to instantiate a Target object and initializes a target value. Afterwards, `parse()` method calls the `AddTargetCommand` and instantiate a `SetTargetCommand` object and returns to the `Parser` object.
The `Parser` object then returns to `ChChing`. `ChChing` object then runs the `execute()` method of the SetTargetCommand object. The method then calls the `setTarget()` method of the `TargetStorage` object to store the previously initialized `Target` object.

![SetTargetCommand UML](images/SetTargetCommand.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### LiveCurrencyApi

`LiveCurrencyApi` class makes an API call to obtain the latest exchange rates from the [ExchangeRateApi](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). The API call is made using the `HttpUrlConnection` class. The API key is used directly in the API call URL, and stored in the URL itself and not as a variable. The values response of the API call is then parse as a string, by formatting the string to obtain the exchange rates of the currencies and ignoring the other text. The currency name is then used as a key to see if it exist in the `selector` hashmap. If it does the exchange rate is added to the `converter` hashmap. The `converter` hashmap is then used to convert the currency of interest to SGD. If the API call somehow fails, there are hardcoded values in the `converter` hashmap that are outdated, but it allows the program to continue to run. The live currency rates are updated every time the user starts the program, however the API itself only updates the rates every 24 hours.
![LiveCurrencyApi_sequence_diagram.png](images/LiveCurrencyApi_Sequence_Diagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### SetCurrencyCommand

The setCurrencyCommand is facilitated by `System`, `Selector`, `UI`, `Parser` and `ExpenseList`.
The command receives the instruction from `UI` and will be parsed by the `parse()` method of the `Parser` object and `getCurrency()` method is called from the `Currency`
which returns the currency that the user wants to set. Then `SetCurrencyCommand` object is instantiated and returned and `execute()` is called.
The `execute()` method in setCurrencyCommand will then call the `containsCurrency(currency)` method from `Selector`.
If the method returns false, which indicates that the currency is not available, the command will throw a new ChChingException and print `"Currency not available"`.
If the method returns true, the command will continue to set the currency in the selector hashmap to true.
Afterwards, the `execute()` method will call the `printSelector()` method from `Selector`.
The `printSelector()` method will print all the available currencies in the selector hashmap.
The selected currencies will be marked with a `[X]` and the unselected currencies will be marked with a `[ ]`.
![SetCurrencyCommand_sequence_diagram.png](images/SetCurrencyCommand_sequence_diagram.png)

### UnsetCurrencyCommand

The unsetCurrencyCommand works in a similar way to the setCurrencyCommand.
The diagram below shows the sequence diagram for the unsetCurrencyCommand.
![SetCurrencyCommand_sequence_diagram.png](images/UnsetCurrencyCommand_Sequence_Diagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find

The FindCommand is facilitated by `System`, `UI`,`Parser`, `ExpenseList` and `IncomeList`.
The command receives instruction `UI` and the input will be parsed by `Parser` using `getType`,`getCategory`, `getDescription` and `getDate` to get the necessary search fields, before the `FindCommand` is instantiated by `Parser`.
The user can choose to search through incomes on description or date. The user can also choose to search through expenses on description, date or category.
The `execute()` method in `FindCommand` will check if the user is searching for income or expense, and ensure that at least one of the search fields are not empty.
By using a loop, the `execute()` method will then search through the `ExpenseList` or `IncomeList` and selected the expenses/incomes that matches the search fields.
The `execute()` method will then print out the selected expenses/incomes that matches the search fields using `showMatchedExpense()` or `showMatchedIncome()` method from `UI` to `System`

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Domain rules:

  - ChChing should not crash under normal circumstances.
  - Dates should be in the format of dd/mm/yyyy, it should be a valid date, and it should not be a future date.
  - Amount should be a positive number.
  - Value amount should only be up to 2 decimal places.
  - Only characters in the english keyboard should be used.

- Constraints:

  - Total number of entries for Expenses and Incomes should not exceed 10 000 each.
  - The '/' should not be used within any of the inputs, unless it is for specifying a category.

- Technical Requirements:

  - ChChing should be able to run on Windows, Mac, or Linux as long as it has Java 11 or above installed.

- Quality requirements:

  - ChChing should be usable to users of all skill and proficiency levels.

- Others:
  - Should user input additional arguments that are not within the scope of the command's input, ChChing would ignore them.
    <br> e.g. category field would be ignored for command: `add income /c income /de salary /da 12-12-2022 /v 3.50`, and `exit /de hello` would still successfully exit ChChing.
  - Should the arguments be in the wrong order, ChChing would still be able to parse the arguments correctly. <br>However, should the command not be written first, ChChing would not be able to parse the command.
    <br> e.g. `add income /de salary /c income /v 3.50 /da 12-12-2022` would successfully add an income entry.
    <br> e.g. `/c income /de salary /da 12-12-2022 /v 3.50 add income` would return an error since `add command` is not written first.
