## Design and implementation

### Architecture

**Main components of the architecture**

![image](./PlantUML/MainArchitecture.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of Duke(main) components and how they interact with each other.
It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes all other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The rest of the App consists of five components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Parser`**](#parser-component): Parses user input.
* [**`Command`**](#command-component): The command executor.
* [**`RecipeList`**](#recipelist-component): Holds the recipe data in the recipe manager by an ArrayList. 
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues 
the command `delete 1`.

### UI Component
The **API** of this component is specified in 
[`UI.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/ui/UI.java).

<!-- ![image](./PlantUML/UIcomponent.png) -->

UI class implements the StringLib interface for some output strings. It is responsible for the following tasks:
* Prints the welcome and goodbye messages.
* Prints the help message, which lists all the commands available and their examples.
* Prints the log messages for some managing operations.
* Prints the error messages for some exceptions.

### Parser Component
The **API** of this component is specified in 
[`Parser.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/parser/Parser.java).

![image](./PlantUML/ParserComponent.png)

Parser class implements the StringLib interface for some output strings and uses `CommandType` enum. 
It is responsible for the following tasks:
* Separates user input into various elements in `Strings` to obtain `Command`, `Recipes`, `Ingredients`, 
`Steps`, `Tag`, etc.
* Uses `CommandType` to generate each type of command.
* Separates `Recipes` into its elements, namely `Ingredients` and `Steps`.
* Handles any other separation tasks in regard to handling various user input `Commands`.

### Command Component
The **API** of this component is specified in 
[`Command.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/command/Command.java).

![image](./PlantUML/CommandComponent.png) 

Command class the StringLib interface for some output strings. It also inherits CommandType Enums for determining the 
correct tasks to be executed. It is responsible for the following tasks:
* Executes the particular command received from the user input, case-by-case.
* Determines if the program termination command has been sent.

### RecipeList Component 
The **API** for this component is specified in 
[`RecipeList.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/recipe/RecipeList.java).

![RecipeList Component](./PlantUML/RecipeListComponent.png)

The class contains the list of `Recipe` objects stored in an `ArrayList` by the program. 
It provides methods for the addition, retrieval and removal of `Recipe` objects from the list.
A `RecipeList#clearRecipeList()` method also exists to allow for quick deletion of all `Recipe` objects.

Each `Recipe` object stores the name of the dish, as well as lists storing `Ingredient` and `Step`
objects, to keep track of the ingredients and steps to create the dish respectively.

While each `Recipe` object will have only one `IngredientList` and `StepList`, each of the lists 
are not limited in how many `Ingredient` and `Step` objects they can store respectively, except that
there must at least be one `Ingredient` at any time.

### Storage Component
The **API** of this component is specified in 
[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/storage/Storage.java).

![image](./PlantUML/StorageComponent.png)

Storage class is responsible for the following tasks:
* Creating the directory for storing save files.
* Setting the file path for save files.
* Creating and writing save files based on the recipe list.
* Scanning the save file directory for saves from previous instances of the programme.
* Loading valid save files found in the directory.

### Recipe Manage Feature
#### Implementation
The recipe manage feature is facilitated by the `command`,`parser`,`recipe` package. 
It implements the following operations: 

- `RecipeList#addNewRecipe()` - Add a new recipe to the recipe list.
- `RecipeList#getRecipeList()` - Get the recipe list.
- `RecipeList#removeRecipe()` - Delete a recipe from the recipe list.
- `RecipeList#clearRecipeList()` - Clear all recipes from the recipe list.

#### Example Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the recipe manage mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time, then inputs 
`add n/MaLaXiangGuo i/Beef, Mutton, Mushrooms t/Chinese s/1` to add a new recipe to the recipe manager. `Duke` calls 
the `parseCommands()` method in the `Parser` class to parse the user input, which will return a `Command` object. 
The `Command` object will then be executed by calling the `Command#execute()` method, which will call the 
`Parser#parseSteps()` method to get the steps of the recipe. 

**Step 2.** The user inputs `chop beef` to add a step for the recipe. `Parser#parseSteps()` receives all the steps and 
returns a `StepList` object. Then we return to the `Command#execute()` method in the `Command` class and call the 
`RecipeList#addNewRecipe()` to add the recipe to the recipe list.

**Step 3.** The user inputs `list` to list all the recipes in the recipe list. `Duke` calls the `parseCommands()` 
method in the `Parser` class to parse the user input, which will return a `Command` object. The `Command` object will 
then be executed by calling the `Command#execute()` method, which will call the `RecipeList#getRecipeList()` to get the 
recipe list. Then we return to the `Command#execute()` method in the `Command` class and call the `UI#showRecipeList()` 
to show the recipe list.

**Step 4.** The user inputs `delete 1` to delete the first recipe in the recipe list. `Duke` calls the 
`parseCommands()` method in the `Parser` class to parse the user input, which will return a `Command` object. The 
`Command` object will then be executed by calling the `Command#execute()` method, which will call the 
`RecipeList#removeRecipe()` to remove the recipe from the recipe list.

**Step 5.** The user executes the `clear` to clear all the recipes in the recipe list. `Duke` calls the 
`parseCommands()` method in the `Parser` class to parse the user input, which will return a `Command` object. 
The `Command` object will then be executed by calling the `Command#execute()` method, which will call the 
`RecipeList#clearRecipeList()` to clear all the recipes from the recipe list.

![Sequence Diagram for Recipe Manage ADD and LIST](./PlantUML/RecipeManage_Add_List.png)
![Sequence Diagram for Recipe Manage CLEAR and DELETE](./PlantUML/RecipeManage_Delete_Clear.png)


### Recipe Find Feature
#### Implementation
The recipe find feature is facilitated by the `command`,`parser`,`recipe` package. 
It implements the following operations:
- `RecipeList#searchRecipeList()` - Find a recipe from the recipe list.

#### Example Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the recipe find mechanism behaves at each step.

In the command line, the user inputs `find MaLaXiangGuo` to find a recipe from the recipe list. `Duke` calls the 
`parseCommands()` method in the `Parser` class to parse the user input, which will return a `Command` object. 
The `Command` object will then be executed by calling the `Command#execute()` method, which will call 
the `RecipeList#searchRecipeList()` to search the recipe list for the recipe. Eventually, the `UI` will be called to 
show the recipe list that contains the keyword with its index.

> The following sequence diagram shows how the recipe find feature works:
![Sequence Diagram for Recipe Find](./PlantUML/FindRecipe.png)

### Recipe Steps Edit Feature
#### Implementation
The recipe steps edit feature is handled by the `command`, `recipe` and `stepList` classes.
The following operations are implemented:
* `RecipeList#getRecipe()` - Retrieves the `recipe` object to be edited.
* `Recipe#getStepList()` - Retrieves the `StepList` of the recipe object to be edited.
* `StepList#editStep()` - Takes in a `stepIndex` of the step to edit, and the user's input,
then replaces the step stored at `stepIndex` with a newly created one.

#### Example Usage
The example usage is based on the assumption that there currently exists at least one step in
the recipe specified.

**Step 1.** In the command line, user inputs `editstep 1` to edit the step in the first `Recipe`
object in the `RecipeList`. `Duke` calls the `parseCommands()` method in the `Parser` class to
parse the user input, which returns a `Command` object of type `EDITSTEP`. Under
`Command#execute()`, this object will be executed.

**Step 2.** Under the `EDITSTEP` case, the number of steps in the specified recipe is first checked.
If there is at least one step in the recipe, a further user input `1` is parsed to an `int` to specify
the step number in the list. It is further converted to the 0-based indexing in the `stepList` by subtracting 1,
to create the required `stepIndex`.

**Step 3.** The `editStep` method under `StepList` then takes in a user input for the description of the
replacement step. It then creates a new `Step` object with this description, then replaces the `Step` object stored at 
`stepIndex`with this new `Step` object.

> The following sequence diagram shows how the recipe steps edit feature works:
![Sequence Diagram for Recipe Edit Step](./PlantUML/EditRecipeSteps.png)

### Recipe Ingredients Edit Feature
#### Implementation

The recipe Ingredient edit feature is handled by the `command`, `recipe` and `ingredientList` classes. 
<br>The following operations are implemented:

* `RecipeList#getRecipe()` - Retrieves the recipe object to be edited.
* `Recipe#getIngredientList()` - Retrieves the IngredientList of the recipe object to be edited.
* `IngredientList#editIngredient()` - Takes in an ingredientIndex of the ingredient to edit, and the user's input, 
then replaces the ingredient stored at ingredientIndex with a newly created one.

#### Example Usage

The example usage is based on the assumption that there currently exists at least one ingredient in
the recipe specified.

**Step 1.** In the command line, user inputs `editingredient 1` to edit the ingredient in the first `Recipe`
object in the `RecipeList`. `Duke` calls the `parseCommands()` method in the `Parser` class to
parse the user input, which returns a `Command` object of type `EDITINGREDIENT`. Under
`Command#execute()`, this object will be executed.

**Step 2.** Under the `EDITINGREDIENT` case, the number of steps in the specified recipe is first checked.
If there is at least one ingredient in the recipe, a further user input `1` is parsed to an `int` to specify
the ingredient number in the list. It is further converted to the 0-based indexing in the `ingredientList` by subtracting 1,
to create the required `ingredientIndex`.

**Step 3.** The `editIngredient` method under `IngredientList` then takes in a user input for the description of the
replacement ingredient. It then creates a new `Ingredient` object with this description, then replaces the `Ingredient` object stored at
`ingredientIndex`with this new `Ingredient` object.

> The following sequence diagram shows how the recipe ingredients edit feature works:
![Sequence Diagram for Recipe Ingredients](./PlantUML/EditRecipeIngredients.png)


### Recipe View Feature
#### Implementation

Viewing recipes is handled by the `command`, `recipe` and `ui` classes
The following operations are implemented:
* `RecipeList#getRecipeFromList()` - Retrieves a Recipe from the RecipeList
* `Recipe#getIngredientList()` - Retrieves the IngredientList for the Recipe
* `Recipe#getStepList()` - Retrieves the StepList for the Recipe
* `UI#showRecipeViewed()`- Prints the IngredientList and StepList for the recipe

#### Example Usage
The example usage is based on the assumption that there currently exists at least
one Recipe stored in the RecipeList.

**Step 1.** In the command line, the user inputs `view 1` to view the first `Recipe` object
in the `RecipeList`. `Duke` calls the `parseCommands()` method in the `Parser` class to
parse the user input, which returns a `Command` object of type `VIEW`. Under
`Command#execute()`, this object will be executed.

**Step 2.** Under the `VIEW` case, the second part of the user's input `1` is parsed to an `int` to obtain the item
number in the list. 

**Step 3.** The method `RecipeList#getRecipeFromList()` is called to retrieve the desired recipe
to be viewed. This method then converts the 1-based item number to the 0-based indexing of `RecipeList`,
then returns the `Recipe` object stored at that index using `recipeList.get()`

**Step 4.** The `Command#execute()` method under case `VIEW` then calls `UI#ShowRecipeViewed` with the retrieved
`Recipe` object as an input parameter. This method calls `Recipe#getIngredientList()` to obtain the
`IngredientList` object for the Recipe, then calls `IngredientList#showList()` to print out the ingredients
for the recipe. The method then follows a similar approach for the steps in the recipe, calling `Recipe#getStepList`
and then `StepList#showStepList()`.

> The following sequence diagram shows how the recipe view feature works:
![Sequence Diagram for Recipe View](./PlantUML/RecipeView.png)

### Help Feature
#### Implementation
The help feature's main functionality is to show users the full list of commands they can use on TOM. 
It is facilitated by the `command`,`parser`,`ui` package. It implements the following operations:

- `UI#showHelp()` - Prints the help message.
- `Parser#parseCommands()` - Parse user input into a Command object containing commandType and fullDescription.
- `Command#excecute()` - Carry out respective tasks based on commandType given.

#### Example Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the help mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time, then inputs `help` to see all possible commands that
can be executed. `Duke` calls the `parseCommands()` method in the `Parser` class to parse the user input, which will 
return a `Command` object. The `Command` object will then be executed by calling the `Command#execute()` method, 
which will call the `UI#showHelp()` method to show all possible commands of the recipe.

## Appendix E - Instructions for Manual Testing

### Initialization 
1. Download the `.jar` file and place it in an empty folder.
2. Open the folder location in a command-line interface. (E.g. Terminal for Windows)
3. Type in `java -jar .\<JAR_FILE_NAME>.jar` where `JAR_FILE_NAME` is the name of the `.jar` file downloaded.
4. A successful launch should show a `data` folder being created and a welcome message as such: 
> ![Welcome Message](./Pictures/welcomeMessage.png)
    
### Appendix E.1 - Adding a recipe
Adding a person by using the `add` command and the recipe to be added.

   `add n/Hotpot i/Beef, Potatoes, Carrots t/Chinese s/4`
   `chop beef`
   `add potatoes`
   `add carrots`
   `cook 5 minutes`
    
    Expected: Recipe is added to the list and the message is shown in the result display.
    ```
    Got it. I've added this recipe:
      [Chinese] Hotpot
    Now you have 1 recipes in the list.
    ```
2. Test case: 
   `add i/Beef, Potatoes, Carrots t/Chinese s/0`
   
   Expected: No recipe is added. Error details shown in the result display.
   ```
    Error in description of inputs!
    Exception occurred:
    Recipe is missing the "NAME" or "INGREDIENTS" or "TAG" or "SUM of the STEPs,
    or there is more than one
    "NAME" or "INGREDIENTS" or "TAG" or "SUM of the STEPs"!
   ```
   
3. Other incorrect add commands to try: 
   1. `add`, 
   2. `add x` (where x does not follow the correct format),

    ```
    Noted. I've removed this recipe:
    [TAG] NAME 
    you have XX recipes in the list.
    ```
2. Test case: `delete 0`
    
    Expected: No recipe is deleted. Error details shown in the result display.
    ```
    Please enter a valid index!
    Valid range: 1 to 1
    ```
3. Other incorrect delete commands to try: 
   1. `delete`, 
   2. `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size),
