## Design

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***architecture diagram*** given above explains the high level design of the program.

Given below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of architecture**

`BrokeMan` has one class [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/brokeMan/BrokeMan.java), which is responsible for:
- At program launch: Initialises the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other
- At program termination: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[`Common`](#common-class) represents a collection of messages used by multiple other components.
[`Exception`](#exception-classes) represents a collection of custom exceptions used by multiple other components.

The rest of the program consists of mainly 5 main components.
- [`Ui`](#ui-component): The Ui of the program.
- [`Parser`](#parser-component): The user input parser.
- [`Command`](#command-component): The command executor.
- [`Save`](#save-component): Reads data from, and writes data to hard disk.
- [`EntryList`](#entrylist-component): The abstract class (with subclasses `IncomeList` and `ExpenseList`) that contains
an `Entry` of linkedList which stores 
the list of entries (incomes / expenses) and its method when program is running.
- [`Budget`](#budget-component) : Stores the list of budget amounts in `budgetEachMonth` and its methods when program is running.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The program will first load the content of the .txt files in the `Data` folder if exists,
and populate the `incomeList`, `expenseList`, and `budgetEachMonth`. The `user`'s interactions with
the `Ui` will be parsed to the `Command` using the `Parser`, and the `parser` will then return the `Command` object
specified, which the `Ui` can execute and format the output to the `user`. When the `user` exits the program, the `Save`
command will be executed and the content in the `entryList` (more specifically `incomeList`, `expenseList`) from `EntryList`, and `budgetEachMonth` from `Budget` will then be
stored into their respective .txt files in the `Data` folder.

### Ui component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/brokeMan/ui/Ui.java)

Below is the UML diagram for Ui class:

![UiClassDiagram](./images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The Ui consists of methods to read inputs from user and to format the outputs to be displayed to the user.

[back to contents](#table-of-contents)

### Parser component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Parser.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/brokeMan/parser/Parser.java)

Below is the UML diagram for Parser class:

![ParserClassDiagram](./images/ParserClassDiagram.png)

How the `Parser` component works:
1. When the `BrokeMan` class calls the `Parser` class to execute a command using the `parseCommand` method. 
2. The `parseCommand` method uses `UserInput` class to split the user input in two, command input and description of command.
3. Depending on the command input, the `parseCommand` method will call its respective `prepareXCommand` (i.e, `prepareDeleteExpenseCommand`).
4. Whenever invalid inputs are given by the user, parser will throw appropriate exceptions, where it will catch itself and return a `InvalidCommand`.
5. The `prepareXCommand` will then return the respective Command object (i.e, `deleteExpenseCommand`) back to the `parseCommand` method and then to the `BrokeMan` class.

---

### Command component

The `Command` component consists of many `Command` classes that executes different commands of the program
when called. It is stored in the [`seedu.brokeMan.command`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/brokeMan/command) package.

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenarios where the user
issues the commands `deleteExpense 1` and `exit`.

![DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram](./images/DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

When the `Ui` reads `"deleteExpense 1"` from `User`, it calls the `parseCommand()` method from `Parser` class
to help parse the user input to `Command` (more specifically, `DeleteExpenseCommand`).
In the `parseCommand()` method, it calls the `prepareDeleteExpenseCommand()` method to help convert the `String` "1" to
`int` 1, and handle the necessary `exceptions`. It then returns a newly constructed `DeleteExpenseCommand(1)` object to `parseCommand()`
method and back to `Ui`. The `Ui` executes the `excute()` method in `DeleteExpenseCommand` object which will call the
`deleteExpense()` method in `EntryList` which will delete the entry of expense in its entryList. The `Ui` will
display successful deletion of expense entry upon completion of delete command.

When the `Ui` reads "exit" from the `User`, it similarly calls the `parseCommand()` method from
`Parser` class to help parse the user input to `Command` (more specifically, `ExitCommand`).
The `Parser` class will return a newly constructed `ExitCommand()` object back to the `Ui`.
The `Ui` executes the `execute()` method of the `ExitCommand` which will call writeFile method in the `SaveBudget`,
`SaveExpense`, and `SaveIncome` classes, in the `Save` folder, and write the content to its respective `.txt`
files in the `Data` folder. Upon completion of the save command, the `Ui` will print the goodbye messages to the
`User` and terminate the program.

### Save component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`SaveBudget.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/brokeMan/save/SaveBudget.java), [`SaveExpense.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/brokeMan/save/SaveExpense.java), [`SaveIncome.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/brokeMan/save/SaveIncome.java)

The `Save` component,

- can save entryList data and budget data in the hard disk as .txt files, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- depends on some classes in the EntryList component and Budget component(because the Save componentâ€™s job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the EntryList and Budget)

[back to contents](#table-of-contents)

---

### EntryList component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`EntryList.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/brokeMan/entry/EntryList.java)

The `EntryList` component,
- stores the entry list data i.e., all `Entry` objects (which can inherit the behavior of `Expense` class or `Income` class)
- stores the `EntryAmountComparator` and `EntryDateComparator` to filter the list. The UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `EntryList` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

Here is the (partial) UML diagram of the `EntryList` component:

![EntryListClassDiagram](./images/EntryListClassDiagram.png)

[back to contents](#table-of-contents)

---

### Budget component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Budget.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/brokeMan/budget/Budget.java)

The `Budget` component,
- stores the monthly budget data in a hashmap
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Budget` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

Here is a UML diagram of the `Budget` component:

![BudgetClassDiagram](./images/BudgetClassUML.png)

### Common class

Messages used by multiple components are in the [`seedu.brokeMan.common`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/brokeMan/common) package.

[back to contents](#table-of-contents)

---

### Exception classes

Exceptions are used mainly by the parser to restrict commands from entering undesirable/unusable inputs provided by the user. 

Possible exceptions in multiple components are defined in the [`seedu.brokeMan.exception`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/brokeMan/exception) package.

## Implementation

### Entry

Below is the UML class diagram for Entry:

![EntryClassDiagram](./images/EntryClassDiagram.png)

Entry class is the underlying superclass for Expense and Income classes. It establishes the common attributes and
methods that are necessary to represent Expenses and Incomes. Abstract class is used to represent their common features
to maximize code reusability and increase maintainability.

**Methods**

The entry class implements getters for its attributes, as other classes may need to access information of the entry (ex. getTime())

editDescription(), editAmount(), editTime(), editCategory()

* Takes in corresponding parameters to edit the private attributes.
* Used by EntryList to make edits

isSameMonth()

* Takes in Integer year and Month and returns if the entry is made in the date specified by parameters.

---

### EntryList

Below is the UML class diagram for EntryList:

![EntryListFullClassDiagram](./images/EntryListFulllClassDiagram.png)

The EntryList class represents a collection of Entry instances. It is an abstract class that serves as a superclass for
ExpenseList and IncomeList classes, providing common functionalities to minimize repetitive code and easing code
maintenance. It provides underlying methods for adding, removing, editing, and listing entries from the list, which can
be expenses or incomes depending on the subclass.

On top of the methods that provide basic functionality of expense/income lists, the EntryList class provides additional
methods such as summing all entries or filtering the entries according to LocalDate provided to the method. Most methods
of EntryList take in a List<Entry>, which is because it has to operate on a list of expenses or incomes passed by the
IncomeList or ExpenseList subclasses.

**Methods**

addEntry(), listEntry(), deleteEntry(), editEntry()

* Underlying methods of the add, edit, view, and delete features of Expense and Income class. 
* Edit entry has different methods for each data stored in an entry. (E.g. amount, time...etc).
   - Edit method makes use of the private edit methods of the Entry class. 

   
getTotalAmount(), sortEntriesByAmount(), sortEntriesByDate(), findEntriesByCategory(), selectEntryForDate(), getEntryListSum()

* Underlying methods of subclasses of EntryList, which are used to implement features that extends beyond the CRUD features.
* They all take in a list of entries, which are IncomeLists or ExpenseLists, then returns appropriate data back to the subclass.
* Filter by date methods make use of java.stream and its filter method to choose out only the entries of appropriate date. To check if the entry is made in the date of interest, the isSameMonth() method of Entry class is used.
* As mentioned above, custom comparators are implemented in the program to sort the entries by an attribute of an entry.

### ExpenseList, IncomeList

Classes ExpenseList and IncomeList are responsible for keeping track of the corresponding entry instances added to the program by the user. 
At a class level, it keeps a **LinkedList** of corresponding entries. 
They both extend EntryList, the abstract class that represents a collection of Entry instances. 
It provides static functionalities of managing and viewing entry instances at a class level. 
Instances of ExpenseList and IncomeList are not created as all functionalities can be provided at the class level. 
  
**Methods**

Most methods of the Income/ExpenseList make use of the underlying methods in the EntryList class.
* For example, the addIncome method makes use of addEntry method of EntryList to add a Income instance in the class-level Linked-List named incomeList. 
   
   
listExpense() / listIncome()

* Overloaded method, may take it no parameter or LocalDate parameter
* If it has no passed parameters, it returns all entries in the list
* If a LocalDate is passed, it returns all entries made in the month specified by LocalDate instance.

### Budget

The Budget class represents the userâ€™s monthly budget. The class utilize class-level hashmaps to represent the monthly
budget, using outer key year and inner key month. It provides a methods setBudget and viewBudget to set and view budget for different months.

It makes use of a static HashMap<Integer, HashMap<Month, Double>> to keep track of monthly budget. If the user tries to
access budget using keys that are not entered in the HashMap, it will return a warning mentioning that the inquired
budget has not been set yet.

---

### SaveExpense, SaveIncome, SaveBudget

The SaveExpense, SaveIncome, SaveBudget classes deal with saving in the user inputted data locally.
So that it can all be later accessed.
They all save once the exit command is set.
So assuming there are no bugs it should save.

**Methods**

writeFile(LinkedList<Entry> expenses/incomes)
* writes to the file in a similar format that is entered in to make a new Expense object within the constructor.

readExpenseFile()

* This method reads in from the saved file either ExpenseData.txt or IncomeData.txt. 
* Reads in and initialized each line as either expense or income. 
* Then adds to the respective list.


writeFile(HashMap<Integer, HashMap<Month, Double>> budget)
* This method writes to the file under ./data/BudgetData.txt file.
* Will write upon exit.
* organizes it based on how it the information is constructed for easy reading.
* Iterates through the outer HashMap then inner.

public static HashMap<Integer, HashMap<Month, Double>> readFile()
* On start up reads through the file ./data/BudgetData.txt.
* Reads in and the year then as a key then the monthly declared budget of the given months.
* Returns this as the initialized budget on start.

### Wishlist (COMING SOON)
   
The Wishlist class represents a good or a product the user wants to purchase in the future that are expensive enough, prompting the user to save up. Users can funnel their income entry to a specific wishlisted-product. Users can view how much percentage of the good's price they have saved up, which can give them further motivation to cut their spendings. Users will be able to add a list of wishlisted products. 
   
They can be implemented through a structure that is similar to Entry and EntryList. Each wishlisted product will be a separate class that stores the information of the good, such as name, price, and the date of wishlist created. 
   
The wishlist entry can then be arranged to a list, where users can easily navigate and compare between different wishlisted products. They can also give priority value to each wishlisted product, which can be used to sort them.

### Spending Advisor (COMING SOON)
   
The spending advisor will be integrated to the product by assisting users to make best consumption choices. The advisor will help users compare prices from different food outlets and shops. As the target user for this program is students, the program will first implement food stalls and shops in NUS, which is where the developers for this program are enrolled. In subsequent iterations of the program, the advisor will expand into other regions and recommend users of the best-value purchases.
