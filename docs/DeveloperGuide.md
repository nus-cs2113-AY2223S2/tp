# Developer Guide

## Introduction

Budget Buddy aims to help those who want a Command Line Interface App that is a one-stop solution to keep track of their
expenses, help them with budgeting and also be help them to visualise what they have spent.

Overspending and the lack of savings is a significant problem found in most fresh graduates. We want to create tools
necessary for them so that they can realize their actual spending and achieve financial freedom in the future.

## Setting up the project

## Design

### General Overview

Below is an architectural diagram that describes the overview of how BudgetBuddy works.

![ArchitectureDiagram.png](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

When the user initialises Budget Buddy, the logic of Budget Buddy will check if there is any pre-existing stored data. This persistence is done by using Gson. It reads stored Json data into classes that will be used in Budget Buddy. As the user interacts with the UI, the logic will change the data of Budget Buddy, which is then written in Json format to update the storage. This process continues until the user exits Budget Buddy.

### Main Component

![MainSequence.png](images/MainSequence.png)

**This diagram only shows the main overview of the application. You can refer to other components for more information.**

In the main class, the main method first calls startApplication() which initalizes the Log Manager for logging (disabled in production stage) and Ui object for printing output messages. After initialized, it will then attempt to
import the user's data from `data.json`. If there is no file, it will initalize a blank data. If importing fails, the
application will print an error message and terminate. Once done, it will greet the user and display the budget progress (for returning users).

The application then runs an infinite loop to take in and execute commands, until when the inputs `exit` to exit the
application. After which, it will output a bye message and exits the application safely.

### Command Component

![Command.png](images/Command.png)

**There are some variables and methods that are not shown in the class diagram for easier readability.**

The command consists of three components: Enum CommandEnum, Abstract class Command and Class CommandParser. Each of them
plays a role in retrieving the commands input by the user and redirecting to the correct components.

For every command that the user wants to execute, the input of the command must be in this format as follows:
> `(command) (action) (parameters) [optional parameters]`

**Command and action names are not case-sensitive, but values are.**
**Also, it is possible to rearrange the order of parameters.**

An example of a command can be seen in the user guide.

For each parameter, the type of value must either be: `integer`, `double`, `date`, or `string`, depending on the parameter's specification.
- integer: Input must be a valid integer.
- double: Input must be a valid double that is positive, must not contain alphabet and at most 2 decimal places.
- date: Input must be a valid date in the format `DD-MM-YYYY`, and year must be in 4 digits.
- string: Input can be in any alphanumeric but at most 30 characters.

Note that the value must not contain any slash (`/`), as it interferes with the parameter format.

#### CommandEnum

The Enum class CommandEnum contains all the commands that are available in the application, as shown in the diagram in Command Component. These are the commands that can only be input in the command line.

#### Command

The abstract class Command extends to several command classes (e.g. `BudgetCommand`, `DepositCommand`, `ExpenseCommand`) and contains abstract (execute() and isExit()) and normal methods.

Each child (extended) class has a list of actions for its command and the list of required & optional parameters for each action. These list of actions and parameters are to be used in the CommandParser class, where it validates the input given by the user. For commands such as Help and Exit, no actions and parameters are required.

In the execute() method, the method is executed from main, where it will go to the action class (eg `BudgetAction`) and run the requested action such as `add` along with the required & optional parameters.
After execute() is done, isExit() controls the termination of the application by returning a boolean.

#### CommandParser

![CommandParserSequence.png](images/CommandParserSequence.png)

The `CommandParser` class is responsible for validating the input given by the user, which in return will pass a Command object (containing the user's requested action) that can be executed.

Flow of the Command Parser:
1. From the main function, it calls CommandParser.parse() with the input from user.
2. Command name from the input is retrieved, returning a CommandEnum
3. Object command is created and initialized by constructor, based on the CommandEnum
4. List of available actions for that command is retrieved. **Commands such as Help and Exit do not have any actions or parameters, which the command will be returned immediately.**
5. Action from the input is checked from the list of actions to see if it valid. Then, it will set the action in command object.
6. Based on the action, it will retrieve the required and optional parameters from input. Then, it will set the parameters in the command object.
7. Object command is returned to the main, which it will be executed.

## Product scope

### Item Component

The main 4 classes of BudgetBuddy are the `budget` , `deposit`, `expense` and `stats` class. Users are able to add, store and visualise the date relate to each of these classes. Each of these classes are modelled as an `Item`.

![Item.png](images/Item.png)

**There are some variables and methods that are not shown in the class diagram for easier readability.**

### Budget Component

#### BudgetCommand Class

The `BudgetCommand` class contains methods that are related to the `Budget` function. Users are able to create
new budgets, which are stored in a budget list. The category word from the user's input is taken from the first word of
the users input,
and the second word of the users input is the action word. The first word is processed through the `CommandParser`
class. If the
Command word is "budget", it will be processed into the `BudgetCommand` class. The action word is then processed into
the `BudgetAction` class.
The class diagram below shows how the `BudgetCommand` parent class is implemented, as well as its extended classes.

![BudgetCommand.png](images/BudgetCommand.png)

#### BudgetCommand Sequence

Once a string `input` from the user has been deemed as a `Budget` command as explained in the `CommandParser` sequence
diagram above,
the `input` will be passed into the `BudgetCommand` class. This class determines what budget commands to carry out to
update the `data` stored in the `Budget` and `Expense` array lists, as shown in the sequence diagram below.

![BudgetCommandSequence.png](images/BudgetCommandSequence.png)

1. The BudgetCommand object retrieves the existing Budget and Exepnse data stored in the Data class. This is retrieved using the getBudgets() and getExpenses() methods, which return the existing budgets and expenses as an array list. 
2. The BudgetAction object is then created, which then creates a BudgetUIResponse object. 
3. Depending on the action of the BudgetCommand, different methods will be called to carry out the related task. The possible actions are add, set, del (delete), list and help. 
4. If the action is add, the BudgetCommand object will self invoke its own executeAddBudget() method, which calls the addBudget() method in the BudgetAction object. This then calls the printBudgetAddSuccessful() in the BudgetUIResponse object, which prints out a message on the command line interface for the user. The sequence will be similar for other BudgetCommand actions. 
5. Following this, the BudgetAction and BudgetUiResponse will reach the end of its lifeline.
6. After calling the related methods based on the action, the BudgetCommand object will call the exportData() method in the Data object, to update the existing data. 
7. The BudgetCommand object then reaches the end of its lifeline, and returns to the CommandParser object that called it.

### Deposit Component

### DepositCommand Class

The `DepositCommand` class contains methods that relate to the execution of the deposit functionality in BudgetBuddy.
Users can
create new deposits with a timestamp (if necessary). These deposits are stored in a deposit list and users can delete
deposits, find
deposits using keywords, and list all deposits.

The user's input is split by the parser in the `CommandParser` class and is redirected to the 'DepositCommand' class if
the first word
is "deposit." Based on the second word, a method in `DepositAction` class is called corresponding to the command
requested by the user.

Attached below is how the `DepositCommand` class is implemented along with its relation with the other `Data` classes
and the abstract
`Command` class.

![DepositCommand.png](images/DepositCommand.png)

**There are some variables and methods that are not shown in the class diagram for easier readability.**

### DepositCommand Sequence

![img.png](images/DepositCommandSequence.png)

Flow of the DepositCommand:
1. DepositCommand calls execute(), which tries and find which command will be parsed.
2. getDeposits() is called to find the Deposit[] from the Data class.
3. DepositCommand then calls the method in DepositAction that matches the actions parsed
4. Within DepositAction, the action is done manipulating the DepositList, if necessary
5. Within Deposit Action, the class DepositUIResponse is called to show an output depending 
   on the action to the user
6. After DepositList is sucessfully manipulated (if necessary) and a text reponse is given, 
   DepositCommand exits.

### Expense Component

### ExpenseCommand Class

The `ExpenseCommand` class contains methods that relate to the execution of the expense functionality in BudgetBuddy.
Users can
create new expense entries with a timestamp (if necessary). These expenses are then stored in an expense list and users
can delete existing
expenses, find expenses using keywords, and list all expenses according to their categories.

The user input is split by the parser in the `CommandParser` class and is redirected to the `ExpenseCommand` class if
the first word is
"expense". Based on the second command word, a method in `CommandAction` class is called corresponding to the command
entered by the user.

Attached below is how the `ExpenseCommand` class is implemented along with its relation with the other `Data` classes
and the abstract
`Command` class.

![ExpenseCommand.png](images/ExpenseCommand.png)

**There are some variables and methods that are not shown in the class diagram for easier readability.**

### ExpenseCommand Sequence

Once a string `input` from the user has been deemed as an `Expense` command, the `input` will be passed into the
`ExpenseCommand` class. This class determines what expense commands to carry out to update the `data` stored in the
`Budget` and `Expense` array lists, as shown in the sequence diagram below.

![img.png](images/ExpenseCommandSequence.png)

Flow of ExpenseCommand:
1. ExpenseCommand calls execute(), which will find the command to be parsed.
2. getExpenses() is called to find the Expense[] from the Data class.
3. ExpenseCommand then calls the method in ExpenseAction that matches the parsed actions.
4. If required, the action is done manipulating the ExpenseList in ExpenseAction.
5. Within ExpenseAction, the class ExpenseUIResponse is called to output a response to the user
depending on the action.
6. After ExpenseList is successfully manipulated (if necessary) and a text response is given,
   ExpenseCommand exits.

### Stats Component

### StatsCommand Class

The 'StatsCommand' class contains methods that are related to the execution of the stats functionality in BudgetBuddy.
Users can
use this command to view all the details of their expenses, budgets and deposits in the current month. Through this
feature, users will know
their current progress and if their expenses have exceeded their budget.

![StatsCommand.png](images/StatsCommand.png)

**There are some variables and methods that are not shown in the class diagram for easier readability.**

### StatsCommand Sequence

![img.png](images/StatsCommandSequence.png)
The StatsCommand class is responsible for displaying the stats based on the inputs by the user.
Flow of the Stats Command:
1.	From the main function, a StatsCommand object is created.
2.	In the StatsCommand, it calls execute which takes in data and ui to execute this command. Within execute, a new object StatsAction is created.
3.	Within StatsAction, getBudgets(), getDeposits() and getExpenses() are called from data, which return the arraylists containing budgets, deposits and expenses respectively.
4.	A new StatsUIResponse object is then created by taking in ui.
5.	This StatsAction object is then returned to StatsCommand.
6.	In StatsCommand, based on the action, different functions are now executed.
7.	If the action is show, executeShowStats(statsAction, optionalParams) is called within StatsCommand.
8.	Within this function, another function showStats(month, year, showDeposit, showExpense) is called in StatsAction. In the showStats function, if showDeposit is true, the function printDeposits(filteredDeposits) is called in DepositUIResponse, which returns an arraylist of strings, depositMsg containing Deposit messages to be printed out. Likewise, if showExpense is true, the function printExpenses(filteredExpenses) is called in ExpenseUIResponse, which returns an arraylist of strings, expenseMsg containing Expense messages to be printed out.
9.	After the two optional blocks, printStats(month, year, totalBudgets, totalDeposits, totalExpenses, budgetMsg, depositMsg, expenseMsg) is called in StatsUIResponse. This in turn prints to the user the stats.
10.	 If action is help, executeHelpStats(statsAction) is called within StatsCommand. The function statsHelp() is then called in StatsAction. This in turn calls printStatsCommands() in StatsUIResponse and prints out the stats help message to the user.



### Others

#### Exception Component

For invalid commands and application errors (such as file), BudgetBuddy will display an error message which requires the user to rectify his/her input or do something, including restarting the application. 

#### File IO Component

The input and output of a file is handled using Gson, a third-party plugin that can help to read/write .json file in the Json format. The data file `data.json` (default) is created under the directory that the user is running at after an action is executed in the application. If the application finds the file to be blank, or the format of json is corrupted, it prompts the user to manually delete the file before starting the application.
**Therefore, It is not recommended for users to edit the file manually.**

## Appendix D: Instructions for manual testing

### Launch

Before starting, ensure that you have Java 11 installed on your operating system.

1. Download the latest [file](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-W15-3/tp/releases) and place in your preferred directory.
2. Launch a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is located.
3. Run the command `java -jar budgetbuddy.jar`
4. Expected Outcome:
   - Budget Buddy will display a greeting message.
   - For first time users, it will display a warning message showing that the data file is empty.
   - For existing users with valid data file, it will show the progress for all budgets.

If you encounter the greeting message displaying as "????", please change your command line/terminal's character encoding to UTF-8.
- For Windows, if you are using command prompt or powershell, change the code page by typing `chcp 65001` in the prompt.
- For Mac, change the Text encoding to `UTF-8` under international section in your Terminal Settings.
- For others, please find a setting that can change the encoding to `UTF-8`. Else if it doesn't work, please test it on another computer.

### Test Cases

Note that for the test cases listed for Budget, Deposit, Expense and Stats Commands, any wrong input is similiar (not the same) to what it has been listed in General Commands. **Each test case is independent from each other and should be start as a first-time user (delete the data file after each case!)**

#### General Commands

1. Invalid command
 - Type `asd`
 - Expected output: An error message `Invalid command. Use help for the list of commands.` is shown.
2. Valid command with invalid action
 - Type `budget asd`
 - Expected output: An error message `Invalid action for budget. Use these actions: add, set, del, list, help` is shown.
 - Note that the actions listed depends on the valid command entered.
3. Valid command and action with missing required parameters
 - Type `budget add`
 - Expected output: An error message `Invalid parameters. Example: budget add /c transport /a 3000.00` is shown.
 - Note that the parameters listed depends on the valid command and action entered.
4. Valid command and action with invalid required parameters
 - Type `budget add /c transport /a asd`
 - Expected output: An error message `Parameter /a: Input must be a valid positive number, with at most 2 decimal places. Invalid parameters. Example: budget add /c transport /a 3000.00` is shown.
 - Note that the message of the invalid parameter depends on the type of parameter set by the application.
5. Valid command and action with invalid optional parameters
 - Type `deposit list /f a`
 - Expected output: An error message `Parameter /f: Input must be in a valid date in this format "DD-MM-YYYY". Invalid parameters. Example: deposit list [/f] 01-01-2023 [/t] 01-03-2023` is shown.
 - Note that the message of the invalid parameter depends on the type of parameter set by the application.

### File Testing

In the application, the data file will be updated/created (if it doesn't exist) whenever commands `budget`, `deposit`, `expense` are executed successfully.
- Deleting the data file and relaunching the application will result in a new data.
- If the data file is empty (still exists), or the contents of the data file could not be Json parsed, the application will detect the file as corrupted, and the user will need to delete the file and relaunch the application.
