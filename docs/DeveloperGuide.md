## Setup

### Setting up the project on your computer

First, **fork** [this repo](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T11-4/tp.git), and **clone** the fork into your computer.

If you plan to use Intellij IDEA (highly recommended):
1. **Configure the JDK**: Follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html) to ensure Intellij is configured to use **JDK 11**.
1. **Import the project as a Gradle project**: Follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html) to import the project into IDEA.<br>
   - Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
1. **Verify the setup**: Run `Main` and try a few commands.

## Design

> The `.puml` files used to create the diagrams in this guide can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T11-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder.

### Architecture

![ArchitectureDiagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The above diagram provides a high-level overview of the program's design, which consists of 5 main components.

- [`ToDoListManager`](#manager-component): Initializes the other components and connects them together
- [`UI`](#ui-component): Handles all input and output between the user and the program
- [`Logic`](#logic-component): Parses user input to commands and executes them
- [`TaskList`](#model-component): Holds the program's data in memory
- [`Storage`](#storage-component): Saves data to the hard disk and loads it during the program's startup

### Manager Component

The code for this component is found in [`ToDoListManager.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/todolist/ToDoListManager.java).

![ManagerClassDiagram](images/ManagerClassDiagram.png)

The `ToDoListManager` component contains the `Ui`, `Logic`, `Model`, and `Storage` components, and depends
on the `Command` class, which is returned by the `Parser` class and executed by the `ToDoListManager`.

The `ToDoListManager` component,
- initializes all the other components that it operates on (`Ui`, `Parser`, `Model`, `Storage`).
- passes user input from the `Ui` component to the `Logic` component, which returns a `Command` object.
- executes the returned `Command` object on the `Model` component, using the `Logic` component.
- calls on the `Storage` component to save the data of the `Model` component locally.

### Ui component

The code for this component is found in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/todolist/ui/Ui.java).

![UiClassDiagram](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The `Ui` component consists of just the `Ui` class.

The `Ui` component,
- gets the user's input with the `getUserInput()` method.
- displays output from executing a `Command` using the `println()` method.
- closes the `Scanner` used to get user input when `close()` is called.

### Logic component

The code for this component is found [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/todolist/logic).

![LogicClassDiagram](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

The `Logic` component contains the `Parser`, `Command`, `ParserUtil`, and `FormatterUtil` classes, as well as
extensions of the `Command` class like the `AddTaskCommand`, `ListTagsCommand`, and `EditEmailCommand` subclasses.

The `Logic` component,
- parses user input through the `Parser` and `ParserUtil` classes, returning a `Command` object (such as an `AddTaskCommand`).
- operates on the `TaskList` and `Config` classes, if needed, when a `Command` is executed.
- invokes the `Ui` component to display the result of executing a `Command`.

### Model component

The code for this component is found in [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/todolist/model).

![ModelClassDiagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component contains the `Config`, `TaskList`, and `Task` classes, and the `Priority` enum.

The `Model` component,
- stores the user's recurrence-related config settings within the `Config`.
- stores the user's tasks within the `TaskList`, which it can operate on.

The `Task` class consists of several attributes:
- An `id`, which is a unique positive `int`.
- A `description`, which is a non-empty `String`.
- An optional `email address`, which must be of a valid email address format and is stored as a `String`.
- An optional `deadline`, stored in a `LocalDateTime` object. 
- A `recurrence count`, also known as `repeat times`, stored as an `int`.
- Any number of `tags`, each of which is a `String`.
- A `priority level`, which is represented as an enumeration `Priority`.

### Storage component

The code for this component is found in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/todolist/storage/Storage.java).

The Storage component can save the task list as TaskList objects in a .json file format using the GSON library and read 
it back into a TaskList object.

## Implementation

> The lifeline of the sequence diagrams in this section should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

### Delete task feature

The DeleteTaskCommand extends NUS To-Do List with a delete feature for the removal of tasks from the task list.
It is facilitated by ToDoListManager, Parser, exception, TaskList and Storage classes.
It implements the `TaskList#deleteTask()` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the DeleteTaskCommand mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the program for the first time. The ToDoListManager will be initialised. This in turn will
then initialise the Parser, TaskList and Storage. Take it as there are no existing tasks read/stored by the program.

Step 2: The user executes `add survey -due 20/03/2023 23:59` command to add a task for the To-Do List.
The add command calls `TaskList#addTask()`, which causes a new Task to be added to the existing TaskList.

Step 3: The user now then decides that adding this task was a mistake, and decides to remove the task from the
To-Do List. The user does this by inputting the command `delete 1` into the terminal to delete a task in the task list.
The command will then call the `TaskList#deleteTask()`, which removes the task at id 1 of the TaskList.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete task operation works:

![DeleteTaskCommandSequence](images/DeleteTaskCommandSequence.png)

### Mark/unmark task feature
The Mark/UnmarkTaskCommand extends NUS To-Do List with a mark/unmark feature for the marking of tasks of the task list
as complete or incomplete.
It is facilitated by ToDoListManager, Parser, exception, TaskList and Storage classes.
It implements the `TaskList#setDone()` operation.

Step 1: The user launches the program for the first time. The ToDoListManager will be initialised. This in turn will
then initialise the Parser, TaskList and Storage. Take it as there are no existing tasks read/stored by the program.

Step 2: The user executes `add survey -due 20/03/2023 23:59` command to add a task for the To-Do List.
The add command calls `TaskList#addTask()`, which causes a new Task to be added to the existing TaskList.

Step 3: The user wants to mark the task as completed by inputting the command `mark 1` into the terminal
to mark the task as done. The command will then call the `TaskList#setDone()`, which marks the task at id 1
of the TaskList as done.

For the unmark command, the user can instead input the command `unmark 1` to set the task as incomplete.
The command also calls `TaskList#setDone()` which sets the task at id 1 to be not done.

The following sequence diagram shows how the mark/unmark task operation works:

### Edit task deadline feature

The edit deadline function extends NUS To-Do List with an edit feature for the deadlines assigned to tasks.
It is facilitated by the TaskList and Command classes. It implements the `TaskList#setDeadline()` operation,
which edits deadline of task at assigned id.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit deadline mechanism will behave at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. There are no existing tasks read by the program.

Step 2. The user executes `add survey -due 20/03/2023 23:59` command to add a task to the To-Do List.
The `add` command calls `TaskList#addTask()`, which causes a new Task to be added to the existing TaskList.

Step 3. The user has received an update about an extension to the deadline for the task, and decides to change
the deadline by executing the `edit 1 -due 25/03/2023 15:00` command. The `edit` will call `TaskList#setDeadline()`,
which updates the value of deadline for the Task item saved at id 1 to the new updated deadline.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operations works:

![EditDeadlineCommandSequence](images/EditDeadlineCommandSequence.png)

### Edit task email feature
The edit email function extends NUS To-Do List with an edit feature to add/edit/delete emails to tasks.
It is facilitated by the TaskList and Command classes. It implements the `TaskList#editEmail()` operation,
which adds/edits/deletes the email of task at assigned id.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit email mechanism will behave at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. There are no existing tasks read by the program.

Step 2. The user executes `add survey -due 20/03/2023 23:59` command to add a task to the To-Do List.
The `add` command calls `TaskList#addTask()`, which causes a new Task to be added to the existing TaskList.

Step 3. The user has the email of a teaching staff for the task, and decides to add
the email to the task by executing the `email 1 -edit username@gmail.com` command. The command will call
`TaskList#setEmail()`, which adds the email address for the Task item saved at id 1.

Step 4. If the user decides to remove the email address for the task, the user can choose to execute `email 1 -del`
command. The command will call
`TaskList#setEmail()`, which removes the email address for the Task item saved at id 1.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operations works:

![EditEmailCommandSequence](images/EditEmailCommandSequence.png)

### Edit task priority feature
The edit priority function extends NUS To-Do List with an edit feature to add/edit/delete priority levels to tasks.
It is facilitated by the TaskList and Command classes. It implements the `TaskList#editPriority()` operation,
which adds/edits/deletes the priority level of task at assigned id.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit email mechanism will behave at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. There are no existing tasks read by the program.

Step 2. The user executes `add survey -due 20/03/2023 23:59` command to add a task to the To-Do List.
The `add` command calls `TaskList#addTask()`, which causes a new Task to be added to the existing TaskList.

Step 3. The user has realised that the tasks has great urgency, and decides to add priority level to the task by
executing the `prio 1 -edit 3` command. The command will call `TaskList#setPriority()`, which sets the priority level
for the Task item saved at id 1 to be high.

Step 4. If the user decides to remove the priority for the task, the user can choose to execute `email 1 -del`
command. The command will call `TaskList#setEmail()`, which removes the priority level for the Task item saved at id 1.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operations works:

![EditPrioritySequence](images/EditPriorityCommandSequence.png)

### Repeating tasks feature

The repeating tasks function extends NUS To-Do List allowing tasks to be listed as repeating for a certain number of
occurrences.
It is facilitated by the TaskList, Storage and Command classes. It implements the `TaskList#setRepeatTimes()` 
which sets the number of times the task is to repeat, and `TaskList#checkRepeatingTasks()` to check for tasks stored
in the TaskList for repeat settings.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the repeating task mechanism will behave at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. There are no existing tasks read by the program.

Step 2. The user executes `add survey -due 20-03-2023 23:59 -rep 3` command to add a task to the To-Do List.
The `add` command calls `TaskList#addTask()`, which causes a new Task to be added to the existing TaskList.

Step 3. The user then exits the program with the saved TaskList.

Step 4. The user opens the program a week after the set deadline of the `survey` task. Since the configuration file is
still at default settings, it will check after every command is executed if any tasks in the TaskList have a repeat 
count of > 0 and is due for repeat after 1 week. Since the existing task fulfils the condition, a new task with the same
description `survey` will be created, with a deadline of 1 week from the original deadline appended to the 
task. (i.e `27-03-2023 23:59`). The repeat count of the original `survey` task will be changed to 0, whilst the new `survey`
task will have a repeat count of 2.

### List tasks sorted by deadline feature

This ListTasksCommand extends NUS To-Do List with an automatic sorting feature that sorts all tasks in an ascending
deadline order and displays the To-Do List to users. It is facilitated by the TaskList, Command class, and UI class.
It implements the `TaskList#toString()` and  `ui#printTaskList()`operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the ListTasksCommand mechanism will behave at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. There are no existing tasks read by the program.

Step 2. The user executes `add survey -due 20/03/2023 12:00` and `add survey -due 21/03/2023 12:00` command to add 2
tasks to the To-Do List. The `add` command calls `TaskList#addTask()` once for each task, which causes 2 new Tasks to
be added to the existing TaskList.

Step 3. The user wants to view the entire list of deadlines that he/she has added. The user can do this by using the
command `list -sort due` into the terminal. By doing so,`TaskList#toString()` will be executed, which will sort
the list in an ascending deadline order, where the deadline that is closest to date will be at the top and the deadline
furthest to date will be at the bottom. Next, `ui#printTaskList()` will be executed, which will display the list of
deadlines to the user in the terminal.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

### Storage feature

The storage feature is facilitated by the `Storage` class.

The Storage class implements the following operations:
- `Storage#save()` --- Saves the current task list.
- `Storage#loadData()` --- Loads a task list from the previously saved file, if there is one.

Given below are 3 example usage scenarios and how the Storage mechanism behaves in each scenario.

Scenario 1: The user launches the application and there is a valid save file found. Storage loads the file successfully
and informs the user of the loaded task list (and how many tasks there are in it).

![StartUpStorageSequenceWithValidSaveFile](images/StartUpStorageWithValidSaveFile.png)

Scenario 2: The user launches the application and there is no save file found. Storage informs the user that there is no
save file found and that a new one will be created for them later.

![StartUpStorageSequenceWithNoSaveFile](images/StartUpStorageSequenceWithNoSaveFile.png)

Scenario 3: The user edits the task list or exits the program. Storage saves the changes automatically into the save 
file. Note that the sequence diagram below shows what happens when the user exits the program, but the processes in
Storage occur even when the user performs other commands to edit the task list.

![ExitProgramStorageSequence](images/ExitProgramStorageSequence.png)

#### Design considerations:

- **Option 1**: Save task list as a self-formatted .txt file which can be printed and used as a physical task list.
    - Pros: Can get a physical task list to use.
    - Cons: Difficult to maintain as Storage class has to be updated whenever more fields are added to Task class. For
          example, if we add a "tag" field to Task, the formatting for the saved .txt file has to be updated to reflect
          that change.
- **Option 2**: Append rather than overwrite when saving the task list.
    - Pros: Will likely be able to save the task list much faster.
    - Cons: Difficult to implement, especially when considering the current mark task operation.
- **Option 3 (current choice)**: Save task list as a json file using the GSON library.
    - Pros: Easy to implement and easy to maintain as Storage class does not have to be updated whenever new fields are 
added to Task class. Do not need to consider whether we use append or overwrite when saving task list as it is 
irrelevant when using this implementation. The GSON library's pretty printing functionality makes the json file very 
easy to read for humans and understand which allows advanced users to easily modify the file for quick updating of their
task list.
    - Cons: Users have to download some dependencies to be able to use the GSON library.

Main reasons for choosing Alternative 3: It is much easier to implement and maintain than the other 2 alternatives,
and we found that the need to download dependencies to use the GSON library would not be a big issue.

### Progress Bar Feature

The ProgressBarCommand extends NUS To-Do List with a progress bar feature for tracking the progress on tasks in the task 
list that must be finished by the current week. It is facilitated by ToDoListManager, Parser, TaskList, TemporalField, 
LocalDate and Ui classes. It implements the `Ui#printProgressBar()` operation, which informs the user of their progress 
using a percentage (up to 2 decimal places) and a bar (where '=' denotes completion and '-' denotes incomplete).

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the ProgressBarCommand mechanism behaves in this scenario.

The user has a task list with 3 tasks that are due this week. Among the 3 tasks, 1 is marked as done. The user executes 
the progress command, which will call `Ui#printProgressBar()`. The user now sees that they have completed 33.33% of 
their tasks and a progress bar to help them visualize their progress.

![ProgressBarCommandSequence](images/ProgressBarCommandSequence.png)

In the above diagram `printProgressBar(completedTasksThisWeek, tasksThisWeek, PROGRESS_BAR_SECTIONS, taskListString)`
is abbreviated as `printProgressBar(...)`.

### Reset feature

The ResetCommand extends NUS To-Do List with a reset feature to allow users to start a new To-Do list if needed.
It is facilitated by ToDoListManager, Parser, TaskList and Ui classes.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the reset mechanism will behave at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the program, assuming the To-Do list is filled with tasks. However, the user realise all the
tasks in the tasks list have expired and wants to remove all of them in a quick way.

Step 2. The user executes `reset` to remove all the tasks and start a new To-Do list.

Step 3.The user would be shown a confirmation message. If the user inputs `YES`, the command calls `TaskList#reset()` to
reset the task list and a reset message will be printed to inform the user that the To-Do list has reset. However, if
the user inputs anything else, a cancellation message will be printed to notify the users.

The following sequence diagram shows how the ResetCommand operation works:

![ResetCommandSequence](images/ResetCommandSequence.png)

### Help List feature

The HelpCommand extends NUS To-Do List with a help list feature to allow users to keep track of all the possible
commands of the program. It is facilitated by ToDoListManager, Parser, Ui classes. It implements the
`Ui#printHelpList(helpMessage)` operation, which displays a help list for the users. Different help lists would be
displayed based on the different `HELP_TYPE` such as `filter` or `sort` or none.

The following sequence diagram shows how the ResetCommand operation works:

### Instructions for manual testing

The following are instructions on how to test the program manually.

- After downloading the jar file from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T11-4/tp/releases/tag/v2.1), run it in a terminal to start the program.
  - Test case: `java -jar NUSTo-DoList.jar`
  - Expected: The startup and save loading messages will be displayed in the terminal.
- Try running some commands - use the command `help` or refer to the [User Guide](https://ay2223s2-cs2113-t11-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html) for a list of commands.
  - Test case: `help`
  - Help message is displayed.
- Try adding a task with various attributes with the `add` command.
  - Test case: `add do homework -due 9/9/2025 19:37 -email rui@gmail.com -tags difficult later -prio 2 -rep 12`
  - The above command adds a task with the description `do homework`, the deadline `9/9/2025 19:37`, the email address `rui@gmail.com`, the tags `difficult` and `later`, the priority level `Medium`, and will recur weekly up to `12` times starting from its deadline.
  - Expected: A message about how the task was successfully added is displayed.
- Try marking a task as complete/incomplete with the `mark` and `unmark` commands.
  - Test case: `mark 1`, `unmark 1`
  - Expected: A message about how the task was marked as complete/incomplete is displayed.
- Try displaying a summary of tasks using the `list` command.
  - Test case: `list -done 1 -sort due`
  - Expected: A summary of tasks is displayed. This particular test case shows only complete tasks, sorted by deadline with earlier deadlines first.
  - You may want to use the `add` and `mark` commands to add more complete tasks after trying this command to see the difference.
- Try displaying the detailed attributes of a task using the `info` command.
  - Test case: `info 1`
  - Expected: All the attributes of the task is displayed.
- Try editing an attribute of a task using the `desc`, `due`, `email`, `tags`, `prio`, or `rep` commands.
  - Test case: `prio 1 -edit 1`
  - Expected: A message about how the task's priority level was edited to `Low` is displayed. You can use the `list` or `info` commands to verify this.
- Try checking all the tags in your task list with the `taglist` command.
  - Test case: `taglist`
  - Expected: A comma separated list of any tags your tasks have is displayed, in lexicographic order.
- Try viewing a summary of this week's tasks, with a progress bar, using the `progress` command.
  - Test case: `progress`
  - "This week" is defined as from this Monday to this Sunday.
  - Expected: A summary of this week's tasks is displayed, similar to the `list` command, along with a progress bar.
  - You may want to add some tasks that will be due "this week" after trying this command to see the difference.
- Try deleting a task from your task list using the `delete` command.
  - Test case: `delete 1`
  - Expected: A message about how the task was deleted is displayed. You can use the `list` command to verify this.
- Try viewing your config settings using the `config` command.
  - Test case: `config`
  - Expected: Your current config settings are displayed.
- Try resetting your task list using the `reset` command.
  - Test case: `reset`
  - You will need to confirm this by entering `YES` (case sensitive).
  - **Warning!** This is irreversible.
  - Expected: Your task list is reset, with all tasks deleted. Running an `add` command will start from id 1 again.
- To exit, use the command: `exit`
  - Expected: The exit message is displayed in the terminal and the program exits, returning control to the terminal.
