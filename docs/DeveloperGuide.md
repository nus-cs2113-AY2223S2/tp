## Backend

The backend uses a simplified RESTful API approach. This allows us to decouple code using the proven industry practices.

![Backend](./static/backend/BackendClassDiagram.png)

To find out more, visit the following sections:
- [API](#api)
- [Add, modify, view or delete an entry - `GET`](#add-modify-view-or-delete-an-entry)
- [Access all entries available - `DELETE`, `GET`, `PATCH`, `POST`](#access-all-entries-available)

<div style="text-align: right;">
   <a href="#table-of-contents"> Back to Table of Contents </a>
</div>

### API
#### Endpoints

![Endpoints](./static/backend/EndpointClassDiagram.png)

Each endpoint is an child class `Endpoint`. Currently there are 2 endpoints available:

| Endpoint   | Method to call          |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| `/entry`   | `callEntryEndpoint()`   |
| `/entries` | `callEntriesEndpoint()` |

##### Creating a request

- To create a request, simply instantiate `seedu.pocketpal.communication.Request`
  with the desired request method.
- If there are any parameters associated with the request, you may add them using `addParam()`

```java
Request req = new Request(RequestMethod.PATCH);
req.addParam(RequestParams.EDIT_DESCRIPTION, "mango juice");
```

##### Making a request

- To call each endpoint, pass the `Request` into its corresponding method in the frontend.
- A `Response` will be returned to the frontend.

> All request body and parameter data should be serialised with `String.valueOf()` if not specified.

```java
Backend backend = new Backend();
Response res = backend.callEntryEndpoint(req);

if (res.getResponseStatus() != ResponseStatus.OK) {
// handle status        
}

Entry entry = EntryParser.deserialise(res.getData());
// process entry
```

## Communication

This project uses a simplified HTTP model, where the frontend sends a `Request` to the backend to perform data-related operations. The backend returns a `Response`, which is then processed by the frontend

![Simplified HTTP Model](static/communication/SimplifiedHTTPClassDiagram.png)

<div style="text-align: right;">
   <a href="#table-of-contents"> Back to Table of Contents </a>
</div>

## Data Structure

We use the `EntryLog` data structure to keep track of the entries entered by the user.

# Testing

## Unit Tests
We adopt the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern for unit tests in this project. 
This allows us to achieve a structured unit tests while balancing code readability and maintainability, and allowing a clear separation of the setup, operations and results. 
For backend testing, we use utility classes such as `EntryTestUtil` and `BackendTestUtil` to reduce code repetition and to simplify the testing process.

__Example:__
  ```java
  @DisplayName("Test /entries [GET]")
  class TestEntriesGet extends EntryTestUtil {
      private static final EntryLog expectedEntryLog = new EntryLog();

      @BeforeEach
      void init() {
          TEST_BACKEND.clearData();
          expectedEntryLog.clearAllEntries();
      }

      @Test
      void entriesEndpointGET_recentEntries_correctEntries() {
          // Arrange
          addEntry(ENTRY_1);
          addEntry(ENTRY_2);
          addEntry(ENTRY_3);
          addEntry(ENTRY_4);
          expectedEntryLog.addEntry(ENTRY_3);
          expectedEntryLog.addEntry(ENTRY_4);

          // Act
          Request request = new Request(RequestMethod.GET); // recent 2 entries
          request.addParam(RequestParams.NUM_ENTRIES, "2");
          Response response = TEST_BACKEND.requestEndpointEntries(request);
          EntryLog returnedEntryLog = EntryLogParser.deserialise(response.getData());

          // Assert
          assertEquals(response.getResponseStatus(), ResponseStatus.OK);
          assertTrue(isSameEntryLog(expectedEntryLog, returnedEntryLog));
      }
  }

<!-- ## Parser

The `Parser` class is a fundamental component instantiated as soon as PocketPal is initialised. Its __purpose__ is to
convert the user's input into structured data which then produces clear instructions for the rest of the program.

Some of its core features include:

- Breaking down user input and extracting the relevant data for further processing.
- Performing input validation and error handling to ensure that input data is in the correct format and ready to be
  processed.
- Converting the input data into the correct format and returning it as a `Command` class to be further processed by the
  application.

Here's a class diagram that shows the core structure of the `Parser` class.

![ParserClassDiagram](static/ParserClassDiagram.png)

How `Parser` works:

1. When a user enters a command, the `Frontend` uses `Parser` to resolve the user input via `parseUserInput()`.
2. Within `parseUserInput()`, the corresponding `parseXCommand()` (`X` is a placeholder for the various command
   names[^1] e.g. `parseAddCommand()`, `parseDeleteCommand()`.)  is invoked to validate that the user input is in the
   correct format. Any exceptions will be thrown and their corresponding error messages will be shown to the user via
   the `ui` class.
2. If the user input is valid, an `XCommand` object containing the relevant data is created and returned.
   E.g. `parseAddCommand()` would create a `AddCommand` object containing the description, price and category.
3. From there, the `XCommand` is ready to be executed by the program. (All `XCommand` classes inherit from `Command` and
   have corresponding `execute()` that carry out their specific instructions.)

[^1]: A list of currently supported commands in PocketPal can be found [here](../../UserGuide.html/features/)

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Parser` component when a user inputs the following
command: `/add McDonalds -c Food -p 10.50`

![ParserSequenceDiagram](static/ParserSequenceDiagram.png) -->

<!-- ## Storage

The `Storage` class is responsible for the serialization of `Entry` data into a csv-like syntax, as well as the deserialization of that data back into `Entry` objects.

The main callable functions to be used are:

- `readFromDatabase()` - Deserializes data stored in text form back into `Entry` objects. Executed when PocketPal is instantiated
- `writeToDatabase()` - Serializes `Entry` objects in `EntryLog` into text form.
- `reset()` - Clears whatever is in the stored text file, without affecting what is in the current `EntryLog`.

The structure of the Storage class is as follows:

![StorageClassDiagram](./static/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Parser` component upon initialization of PocketPal, as well as whenever data is being saved.

![StorageSequenceDiagram](./static/StorageSequenceDiagram.png) -->

<!-- ### Add Command
The add entry mechanism is facilitated by `EntryLog`. Every instance of `AddCommand` is created with an `Entry` instance.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add command work:

![AddCommandSequenceDiagram](./static/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `EntryLog` will be initialized and contains no entry.

Step 2. The user executes `/add Lunch at McDonalds -category Food -price 19.9` command to add an `Entry` to the `EntryLog`.

_***Note.*** The command will fail its execution if its format is incorrect, and no `Entry` will be added to the `Entrylog`. An error message will be displayed informing the user._

Step 3. The command will be resolved by `Parser`, which would create an `AddCommmand` object.

Step 4. The `AddCommand` constructor creates and returns an `Entry` object containing the description, price and category to be added.

Step 5. When `execute()` method is called, a `Request` object is created.

Step 6. From there, the `Request` is ready to be handled. `addEntry()` method is called and the new `Entry` is added to the `EntryLog`.

Step 7. A success message is after the new `Entry` is added to the `EntryLog`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add command:

![AddCommandActivityDiagram](./static/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png) -->

<!-- ### Delete Command
The delete entry mechanism is facilitated by `EntryLog`.

Every instance of `DeleteCommand` is created with an Integer, which is the ID of the `Entry` to be deleted.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete command work:

![DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram](./static/DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user decides to remove an `Entry` from the `EntryLog` and executes `/delete 1` command.

_**Note:** The command will fail its execution if the index provided is invalid, and no `Entry` will be removed from the `EntryLog`. An error message will be displayed informing the user._

Step 2. The command will be resolved by `Parser`, which would create an `DeleteCommmand` object containing the index of the `Entry` to be deleted.

Step 3. When `execute()` method is called, a `Request` object is created.

Step 4. From there, the `Request` is ready to be handled. `deleteEntry()` method is called and the `Entry` is removed from `EntryLog`.

Step 5. A success message is after the `Entry` is removed from `EntryLog`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delete   command:

![DeleteCommandActivityDiagram](./static/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.png) -->

## Edit Command

### Implementation

**Step 1.** User runs Edit command, specifying the ID of the entry to edit, as well as the new attributes of the respective
fields.

**Step 2.** Parser extracts the relevant argument and returns a EditCommand object.

**Step 3.** The execute method of the EditCommand is called and a Request object is created. This request object specifies
the modifications of the various fields.

**Step 4.** The Request object is then parsed as an argument to the Backend Class, which parses this request as an argument
to a method in the EntryEndpoint class.

**Step 5.** The EntryEndpoint class then finds and modifies the entry as specified by the user.

**Step 6.** Upon successful completion of the modification, the EntryEndpoint class returns a Response object to the Backend
class. The Response object contains the updated fields of the entry.

**Step 7.** The Backend class calls the save() method to update the Storage class with the edited entry.It then returns
the Response object to the execute function in the EditCommand object.

**Step 8.** The printExpenditureEdited method under the UI class is then called in the execute function and an
acknowledgement message is printed to the user.

<!-- ## Instructions for manual testing

### Testing with sample data (from file)

PocketPal stores data in a *storage.txt* file under the "*data/*" directory. Each row in the "*storage.txt*" file
represents a single expense Entry. Each column in each row should have 3 columns, representing the *description* of the
Entry, *amount* associated with the Entry and *category* of the Entry in that order, and are separated with the ","
delimiter. All of them are in the String format.

An example *storage.txt* file that will be readable by PocketPal is as such:

'''
Apple Juice,5.50,Food
Bus Card,50,Transportation
Paracetamol,10.39,Medical
'''

which will give us 3 Entries.

As of the time of writing, the available categories are:

- Clothing
- Entertainment
- Food
- Medical
- Others
- Personal
- Transportation
- Utilities
- Income

An empty input for category is not allowed. If necessary, use the "Others" category.

## Exceptions

Exceptions are thrown for a couple of cases where files are being read. If you wish to test the exceptions, they can be
replicated as follows:

1. Delimiter is invalid: If the delimiter is not the comma (","), it is not recognised as a delimiter and will not be
   processed correctly.
   Example row: Apple Juice|5.50|Food - In this case, the pipe ("|") is used as a delimiter, which is not allowed.
2. Amount is invalid: If the amount is not a numeric, it is not recognised as a valid amount and will not be processed
   correctly.
   Example row: Apple Juice,5A6B,Food - In this case, the amount is "5A6B", which is not a numeric and therefore not
   allowed.
3. Category is invalid: If the category is not a string from the list of allowed categories (see above), it is not
   recognised as a valid category and will not be processed correctly.
   Example row: Apple Juice,5.50,Drink - In this case, the category is "Drink", which is not a valid category and
   therefore not allowed.
4. Not enough columns: If a row has insufficient columns compared to what is needed, the Entry cannot be created.
   Example row: Apple Juice,5.50 - In this case, there are only two categories which is not allowed.

# Launching of PocketPal

First, place the downloaded *PocketPal.jar* into an empty folder. Launch Windows Powershell in the
directory of *PocketPal.jar* and run the following command to launch PocketPal.

`java -jar PocketPal.jar` -->
