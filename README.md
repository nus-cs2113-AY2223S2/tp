# _BadMaths_ ➕➖✖️➗

BadMaths is an integrated study tool that performs Mathematical Operations and contains various features for note-taking.

To help you get started, our team has put together this user guide to guide you on the steps to operate BadMaths for your study woes.

## Setting up

Prerequisites: JDK 11 (use the exact version), update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. **Ensure Intellij JDK 11 is defined as an SDK**, as described [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk) -- this step is not needed if you have used JDK 11 in a previous Intellij project.
2. Download the latest JAR release [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F10-2/tp/releases).
3. Copy the JAR file into an empty folder.
4. Open up a command window in that folder and run the following command:
```
java -jar BadMaths.jar
```
If the set-up is correct, you should see the following:
```
